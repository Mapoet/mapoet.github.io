## 摘要

This study investigates the global ionospheric responses at different altitudes during the geomagnetic storm in September 2017 by using the observations from IGS GIMs and GRACE, TerraSAR-X, COSMIC, Metop LEO satellite missions. According to different satellite heights, a hierarchical subtraction method is proposed to characterize the disturbance of total electron content (TEC) at the vertical regions of below 340km, 340∼520km, 520∼800km and above 800km, respectively. The integrated TEC from IRI-Plas2017 are applied to verify the feasibility and rationality of the proposed method and the electron density (Ne) profiles from the ionosonde and radio occultation (RO) measurements are used to explore the variations of Ne in different height regions. The resulting TEC disturbances (ΔTEC) on a global scale show that: 1) There was significant increase on Ne peak in F2 region during the magnetic storm, due to the strong recombination in the lower ionosphere while more intense electron ionization in the upper ionosphere; 2) During the main phase, TEC enhancement had a tendency to drift westward, which may correlate with the twice Dst minimums. 3) The east–west and north–south hemispheric asymmetry of ΔTEC exist simultaneously in this magnetic storm. However, the former is mainly attributed to ionospheric plasma bubbles, while the latter might be the seasonal thermospheric effects or the energetic particle emissions.

## 1. Upper Troposphere Lower Stratosphere Composition Change in Tropical Cyclones: Assessments From 17 Years of Satellite Observations

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  In addition to posing threats to life and property, tropical cyclones (TCs) can influence the chemical composition of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). The transport of air between the troposphere and stratosphere, known as stratosphere‐troposphere exchange (STE), involves greenhouse gases such as ozone and water vapor whose impact on Earth's radiation budget and climate is most sensitive to changes in UTLS composition. Therefore, we examine observations of STE in TCs and relate these changes to TC and environmental characteristics. We utilize 17 years of trace gas profiles from the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Aura satellite in conjunction with TC track information and environmental data to relate UTLS ozone and water vapor changes to TC intensity, distance from TC center, and environmental wind shear. We find that accounting for varying tropopause heights and basin‐specific background composition is important to accurate assessment of UTLS composition changes within a TC. We also find that TCs are associated with increased water vapor throughout most of the UTLS and dehydration at tropopause level, while ozone is reduced greatly in the upper troposphere. All diagnosed UTLS composition changes demonstrate significant sensitivity to distance from TC center and TC intensity. Additionally, we find that TC‐induced UTLS water vapor changes are sensitive to environmental shear magnitude, where weaker shear is associated with more pronounced tropospheric hydration and tropopause dehydration.

## 2. Increasing Temporal Variability of Global Tropical Cyclone Near‐Storm Rainfall Under Global Warming: Insights From CMIP6 HighResMIP Simulations

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Tropical cyclone (TC) rainfall poses a significant threat to coastal regions, particularly in the near‐storm region, where the inner core's strongest convection occurs. Temporal variability in the near‐storm rainfall rate over a TC's lifetime, including rapid increases and decreases in rainfall rate, impacts forecast accuracy and hazard preparedness. Using multiple HighResMIP CMIP6 simulations under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario, we find that near‐storm rainfall rate temporal variability increases under pronounced anthropogenic warming, driven primarily by elevated atmospheric moisture. Analysis of relative rainfall rate changes suggests that this heightened variability aligns with rising near‐storm rainfall rate trends. These findings have critical implications for coastal communities, highlighting not only the increased risk of near‐storm rainfall but also the rapid intensification or decline of these rainfall events.

## 3. Interdecadal Changes in the Interannual Variability of the East Asian Winter Temperature since 1880

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  This study investigates the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of the interannual variability changes in the winter East Asian–averaged surface air temperature (EASAT) since 1880. The results reveal that the EASAT interannual variability experiences interdecadal enhancement during 1934–63 (P2) but suppression during 1890–1933 (P1) and 1964–2001 (P3). This fluctuation is driven by the interannual variability changes in the western part of the East Asian trough (WEAT), primarily through modulating downward surface shortwave radiation of clouds. The WEAT variability changes are closely related to the variations of the background zonal wind and meridional temperature gradient around midlatitude East Asia, which are stronger during P2 but weaker during P1 and P3. As a result, the amplified transient eddy feedback forcing and the enhanced available potential energy extraction cause stronger variability in the WEAT and the EASAT during P2 compared to P1 and P3. Moreover, the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) phase shifts excite a zonal Rossby wave train across the Eurasian continent, inducing the anomalous meridional dipole circulations over East Asia and explaining the interdecadal variations of the background zonal wind and meridional temperature gradient. The positive AMO phases amplify the EASAT variability and vice versa.

                    <jats:title>Significance Statement</jats:title>
                    Amplified temperature variability increases the risk of cold and warm extremes, causing significant socioeconomic impacts. This article investigates changes in the interannual variability of the East Asian winter temperature. Based on long-term observational and reanalysis datasets, our results display strong variability during 1934–63 but weak levels during 1890–1933 and 1964–2001. Those changes are driven by the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), which affects the intensity of the transient eddy feedback to the mean flow and the strength of baroclinic energy conversion over midlatitude East Asia. As such, precise forecasting of the AMO helps predict the temperature variability over East Asia and manage the risk of temperature extremes.

## 4. Impacts of Summer Madden–Julian Oscillation Diversity on Multiple Tropical Cyclone Events over the Western North Pacific

                    While previous studies have extensively examined the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) influence on tropical cyclone (TC) activity, they often overlook the substantial diversity in MJO propagation behavior. This study addresses this gap by classifying summer MJO events into four distinct patterns—stationary (Stand), jumping (Jump), slow eastward propagating (Slow), and fast eastward propagating (Fast)—using a
                    <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>
                    -means clustering method. We investigate how each MJO pattern modulates the occurrence of multiple tropical cyclone events (MTCEs; multiple TC formations within 3 days) over the western North Pacific (WNP) and explore the associated physical mechanisms. Results show that the Slow and Fast patterns account for ∼80% of all MTCEs, with the Slow pattern contributing the most (59%). The Slow pattern is characterized by prolonged eastward propagation and a broad meridional extent, which enhances moisture convergence and ascending motion, thereby promoting widespread TC genesis. The Fast pattern is associated with a more zonally extended monsoon trough and enhanced vorticity stretching, supporting MTCE formation but with less clustering due to its rapid progression. In contrast, the Jump pattern exerts a weaker and more localized influence, while the Stand pattern—with convection confined to the Indian Ocean—has negligible impact. These results highlight the critical role of MJO diversity in shaping intraseasonal TC variability and offer insights for improving TC prediction over the WNP.

                    The Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), a crucial component of atmospheric intraseasonal variability, plays a pivotal role in modulating the genesis of multiple tropical cyclones (MTCs) over the western North Pacific, while exhibiting significant diversity in its behavior. This study investigates the physical mechanisms by which distinct MJO patterns influence the formation of MTC events. The results highlight the importance of recognizing MJO diversity for improving the prediction of multiple TC events during active typhoon seasons.

## 5. Inland Tropical Cyclone Impacts in a Warming Climate: Semi-Idealized Simulations of Hurricane Fran (1996 and 2096)

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  
                    This study examines the factors that affect the inland impacts of landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs), and how they will change in a warming climate. Our focus is primarily on near-surface winds though we also consider the combined hazard of concurrent heavy rain and strong wind. We adopt a pseudo–global warming numerical modeling strategy based on an observed landfalling TC in the southeastern United States: Hurricane Fran (1996). To eliminate the effects of terrain and coastline complexity, an additional semi-idealized ensemble experimental design without terrain and with a straight coastline is used to simulate present-day and future landfalls. The TC in the future ensemble exhibits greater landfall intensity, a smaller radius of maximum wind, and slightly weaker outer-core maximum wind speeds relative to the present-day ensemble. We find that while the TC decay rate increases in the future warmer climate, the inland extent of damaging winds nevertheless increases in the future ensemble due to stronger landfall intensity. Metrics related to the areal extent and coverage of overthreshold values prove to be an important measure of hazards and their change. The area of simulated concurrent tropical-storm-force wind speeds and rain exceeding 25 mm h

                    <jats:title>Significance Statement</jats:title>
                    The purpose of this study is to better understand how climate change will affect inland tropical cyclone (TC) impacts, specifically changes to the rate of weakening after landfall, the coverage of damaging winds, and the combined occurrence of strong winds and heavy rain. This is important because recent studies have shown that inland TC decay rates may decrease in the future. Our results show that intensity is a leading control for decay rate, and more intense storms decay at a faster rate, leading to an increased decay rate in the future. Despite faster decay, we find increased future coverage of damaging winds and of combined wind/rain occurrence, which would increase TC risk for future inland populations.

## 7. Climatology of Warm Conveyor Belt Contributions to UTLS Moisture in ERA5 between 2010 and 2019

**作者**: Ziyan Guo, Annette Miltenberger

**期刊**: Journal of Climate

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The altitude region around the extratropical tropopause features strong gradients in thermodynamic properties and atmospheric composition, e.g., in water vapor, ozone, and aerosol content. These constituents are radiatively active, and their distribution in the extratropical upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) is known to be an important determinant of the climate state and its future evolution. Nonetheless, accurately modeling the trace gas distribution in the UTLS remains challenging due to it being determined by multiscale interactions between dynamical, chemical, and microphysical properties. A key source of water vapor in the UTLS is thought to be transport from the planetary boundary layer and mainly occurs in deep convection and warm conveyor belts (WCBs). In this study, we quantify the moisture transport by WCBs into the UTLS using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset with a focus on the Northern Hemisphere. We find that WCBs are associated with a positive condensate anomaly in the upper troposphere (UT) within the storm track regions. Particularly, parcels that ascend rapidly (ascent times no more than 10 h) are transporting very humid air to the UT. The accurate representation of convective and rapid ascent processes may therefore be crucial. The positive condensate anomaly persists, on average, until 6 h after end of ascent. We further find that in DJF the WCB moisture transport by gridscale advection accounts for up to 13.8% (23.3%) of the total water (condensate) transport into the upper troposphere above the North Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins.

                    The altitude region around the extratropical tropopause is characterized by strong gradients in thermodynamic properties and atmospheric constituents that are important for the climate state and its future evolution. One of the key radiatively active constituents is water vapor. We, for the first time, climatologically quantify one of the key source processes of water vapor in the extratropical upper troposphere: transport by warm conveyor belts (WCBs). We find that in ERA5 WCBs are associated with the most humid atmospheric profiles in storm track regions and account for about 15% of the DJF total water flux with strong contributions from rapidly ascending air parcels. Thereby, this study serves as a baseline estimate and guideline for future characterization with observational data.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The assimilation of satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) has been acknowledged to improve the upper-ocean stratification and the relevant oceanic processes. In this study, we focus on assessing the impact of SSS assimilation on predicting the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) propagation across the Maritime Continent for eight representative MJO cases using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction system, version 2 (GEOS-S2S-2). Two sets of forecast experiments are performed: one initialized from the operational ocean analysis without SSS assimilation, referred to as control (CTL), and the other initialized from the ocean analysis with SSS assimilation (SSS). Evaluated with the large-scale precipitation tracking method for these eight MJO events, the SSS forecasts outperform the CTL forecasts, showing better agreement with the observed eastward propagation over the Maritime Continent. In the SSS forecasts, the deeper mixed-layer depth (MLD) and greater upper-ocean heat content (OHC) result in reduced surface cooling during MJO convection. This leads to higher sea surface temperature (SST) compared to the CTL, which enhances latent heat flux anomalies via wind convergence and further supports MJO propagation. Based on the results of these representative MJO cases, this study suggests that improved initialization of ocean stratification and OHC in the upper ocean, enabled by SSS assimilation, can help partially overcome the MJO Maritime Continent prediction barrier and thus strengthen subseasonal forecast skills.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Both the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) and external forcings are recognized as key drivers of interdecadal variations in East Asian summer precipitation. However, considerable debate persists regarding the specific contributions of the AMV and external forcings to these variations. To address this issue, we analyzed both the large ensemble historical all-forcing twentieth-century experiments and two types of North Atlantic pacemaker experiments—one with time-evolving external forcings and one with fixed 1920 forcings. Our analysis demonstrates that AMV is a dominant driver of interdecadal variations in East Asian summer precipitation. In particular, a negative AMV-like North Atlantic cooling weakened the East Asian summer monsoon, leading to the late 1960s shift through two atmospheric pathways: a midlatitude Rossby wave train and an equatorial Kelvin wave. The external forcings have contributed to a drying trend along the Yellow and Huaihe River valleys since the 1960s, when the anthropogenic forcings have been strong. The shift observed in the late 1990s, characterized by a northward migration of the precipitation belt, was driven by both the positive AMV phase and the external forcings.

                    <jats:title>Significance Statement</jats:title>
                    East Asian summer precipitation has exhibited pronounced interdecadal variability since the twentieth century, significantly affecting local ecosystems, water resources, and industries. This variability is influenced by multidecadal oceanic variability, such as the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV), and external forcings, though distinguishing their impacts has been challenging. By analyzing multitype large ensemble and pacemaker simulations, we demonstrate that both AMV and external forcings regulate interdecadal shifts in East Asian summer precipitation. The negative AMV phase led to the late 1960s shift, while the late 1990s shift was influenced by both the positive AMV phase and external forcings. Our findings contribute to the long-standing debate regarding the roles of oceanic variability and external forcings in the interdecadal variation of East Asian summer precipitation.

## 11. High-Resolution CMIP6 Models Better Capture Southern High Mountain Asia Precipitation Trends

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Summer precipitation over High Mountain Asia (HMA) has exhibited a dipolar trend over the past 50 years, with a drying trend in the southern HMA. Understanding the underlying mechanisms relies heavily on climate models. However, the impact and mechanisms of model resolution on the simulation of long-term precipitation trends over this complex terrain area of HMA remain underexplored. In this study, we use six pairs of CMIP6 models with high- and low-resolution historical climate simulations to investigate the resolution-dependent differences in the long-term trends of summer precipitation from 1951 to 2014. The results show that compared to low-resolution models, the simulations from high-resolution models are closer to observations, with the largest improvement in the southern margin of the HMA and surrounding areas (STP), where the wet bias is reduced by approximately 65%. We explore the mechanism behind the reduction in wet bias by conducting moisture budget and moist static energy budget analyses. We find that the reduced wet biases result from an anticyclonic circulation over the northern Bay of Bengal, which transports dry air to the STP and suppresses local convection over there. The anticyclone is a Rossby wave response to negative heating associated with suppressed precipitation over the Maritime Continent and the South China Sea, which is further traced to improved simulation of the central-warm tropical Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) pattern by high-resolution models. We emphasize the remote Indian Ocean forcing instead of local orographic forcing in improving the simulation of long-term precipitation changes in the southern HMA.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Naturally occurring whistler‐mode waves in near‐Earth space play a crucial role in accelerating electrons to relativistic energies and scattering them in pitch angle, driving their precipitation into Earth's atmosphere. Here, we report on the results of a controlled laboratory experiment focusing on the excitation of whistler waves via temperature anisotropy instabilities–the same mechanism responsible for their generation in space. In our experiments, anisotropic energetic electrons, produced by perpendicularly propagating microwaves at the equator of a magnetic mirror, provide the free energy for whistler excitation. The observed whistler waves exhibit a distinct periodic excitation pattern, analogous to naturally occurring whistler emissions in space. Particle‐in‐cell simulations reveal that this periodicity arises from a self‐regulating process: whistler‐induced pitch‐angle scattering rapidly relaxes the electron anisotropy, which subsequently rebuilds due to continuous energy injection and further excites wave. Our results have direct implications for understanding the process and characteristics of whistler emissions in near‐Earth space.

## 13. Response of Changes in Sea Ice Thickness to Cyclones: New Insights from the MOSAiC Expedition

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  
                    Sea ice thickness (SIT) is essential to evaluate sea ice mass balance in the Arctic, regulating the feedback of the sea ice–ocean system to the lower atmosphere, as well as the physical processes of the sea ice itself. In this study, we elucidate the response of SIT change to cyclones across the region of ∼50 km from both thermodynamic and dynamic perspectives and quantify their relative contributions at a synoptic time scale. The latest observations collected during the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition, combined with atmospheric reanalysis, are utilized. We reveal that the interest period of the MOSAiC year (November 2019–July 2020) was characterized by more frequent and intensified storm events with 39 cyclones hitting the ice camp during the 9-month drift. In the observed cyclone events, the primary thermodynamic response was through ice-bottom growth or melt governed by the surface radiation budget and thermal conduction within the ice, which was adjusted by the airmass advection associated with cyclones; the dynamic response of the SIT lay on the ice deformation events induced by the wind forcing when cyclone occurred. The conditions of near-surface atmosphere and sea ice during cyclone periods were significantly different from those of noncyclone periods. Moreover, during different cyclone periods throughout the ice season, the average thermodynamic and dynamic contributions to the SIT change are estimated to be 0.02–1.44 cm day
                    <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The Organization of Tropical East Pacific Convection (OTREC) experiment took place from 5 August to 9 October 2019 in Costa Rica, with additional measurements collected in July and August of 2022. To observe the interaction of tropical easterly waves (TEWs) with the diurnal cycle over Central America and to assess the wave vertical structure over land, we installed a network of 15 global positioning system receivers with meteorological packages (GPS-Met), as well as two radiosonde sites, from the Caribbean to the Pacific coast. An outgoing longwave radiation (OLR)-based wave index indicates that 13 TEWs passed over the surface network during OTREC, with an additional 15 waves during 2022. The relative phasing of peak GPS column precipitable water vapor (PWV) with peak rainfall, together with vertical velocity and moisture profiles of wave active phases from reanalyses, suggests that isolated convective systems with lower-tropospheric heating and moisture evolve into more organized convective systems with elevated heating and moistening as the wave’s active phase progresses inland over Costa Rica. The signatures of propagation in rainfall, PWV, and cloud-top temperature are most pronounced for the active phase, with rain events observed to propagate westward across the network with about a 12-h lag from coast to coast. In contrast, local diurnal land–sea-breeze interactions with strong surface heating play an important role in the timing of convection during the suppressed phase.

                    <jats:title>Significance Statement</jats:title>
                    The results of this study shed light on how tropical easterly waves, westward-propagating disturbances observed over tropical latitudes, interact with the diurnal cycle in rainfall, land–sea-breeze circulations, and low- and midlevel easterly winds over Central America, enhancing the frequency and amount of rainfall and modulating its timing over the region. These results not only highlight the importance of scale interactions in rainfall processes for tropical land areas with strong oceanic influences but also provide situational awareness to operational forecasters tasked with predicting local-scale impacts of synoptic weather events.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  
                    Radiative–convective equilibrium (RCE) is an idealized model of the atmosphere in which surface fluxes exactly balance radiative cooling. While recent work has shown RCE over land is a reasonable first-order model of continental climate, previous RCE studies have mainly focused on ocean surfaces. Unlike the ocean, the land surface has limited water and a low heat capacity. Here, we use theory and simulations to understand RCE over an idealized land surface with fixed soil moisture, a logical next step in the land climate model hierarchy. The fixed soil moisture case is also relevant to irrigated areas, groundwater-fed ecosystems, and broader debates about potential evapotranspiration (PET), aridity, and their changes in a warming world. We derive a parsimonious gray gas theory that reproduces major aspects of cloud-permitting simulations of RCE over an idealized land surface and permits analytic solutions for several special cases. Over fixed dry surfaces, the theory shows that hydrological sensitivity follows Clausius–Clapeyron scaling, considerably greater than the typical 2%–3% K
                    <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>
                    over oceans. Over fixed saturated surfaces, the theory reconciles divergent explanations for hydrological sensitivity based on surface and atmospheric energy budgets, with changes in near-surface relative humidity playing a key role. Finally, the theory shows that PET primarily scales with surface net radiation, rather than temperature or vapor pressure deficit, in agreement with recent empirical findings. The predicted PET scaling implies only modest changes in global mean aridity with warming, rather than the large increases implied by some prior studies. Biological plant responses to increasing carbon dioxide (CO

                    <jats:title>Significance Statement</jats:title>
                    Will global warming make the world more arid? There has been a lot of debate on this question, with some arguing it will drastically increase aridity. Answering it requires understanding changes in atmospheric water demand: the evapotranspiration that would occur if the land surface was always kept saturated. We use basic physics to understand climate over land surfaces in which soils are kept saturated—and, more broadly, fixed at any level of saturation, from wet to dry. Our results support the view that global warming will not drastically increase aridity, on average. We also show that rainfall increases with warming at a faster rate over fixed dry land surfaces than it does on Earth (where land surfaces change from dry to wet and back again).

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  As the climate is rapidly changing, regions with tight water budgets such as the American Mountain West will experience changes in their water availability that can have substantial impacts on agriculture, industry, and drinking water. In the American Mountain West, the amount of water available throughout the year is largely dependent on the mass of the wintertime snowpack that melts throughout the spring and summer, filling the downstream rivers and reservoirs. We provide an overview on how snowpack in the ERA5-Land reanalysis record has changed during the past century of warming and compare these changes with the historical simulations from an ensemble of CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) to determine how skillful they are at predicting snowpack in the Mountain West, which models are the most skillful, and how we can constrain future predictions by selecting only the models with the best simulation of historical snowpack. We perform analytical and Gaussian process emulation decompositions of the historical snow water equivalent (SWE) changes to determine which processes are responsible for the spread in GCMs’ simulation of historical SWE. Taken together, these analyses show that intermodel spread in SWE change is mostly driven by spread in GCMs’ simulation of large-scale changes in surface temperature, precipitation, and evaporation, which drives spread in the amount of fallen snow that remains in the snowpack in the spring.

## 17. The Role of Ocean Processes in Future Northern Hemisphere Midlatitude Winter Precipitation Changes

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  In response to anthropogenic emissions, winter net precipitation (precipitation minus evaporation) in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes is projected to considerably intensify by the end of this century. Previous studies argued for the importance of surface quantities in setting precipitation changes. Thus, to elucidate the future changes in precipitation, it is crucial to examine the changes in ocean processes, as they play a fundamental part in the surface response to anthropogenic emissions. In this study, we use a hierarchy of ocean coupling simulations to quantify the relative roles of the ocean, and its dynamic and thermodynamic components, in the projected intensification of Northern Hemisphere midlatitude winter net precipitation. We find that the increase in midlatitude net precipitation over land and the Pacific Ocean stems from the impact of thermodynamic ocean processes, which mostly act to warm the surface, increase the meridional moisture gradient, and thus the moisture flux convergence by midlatitude eddies. In contrast, over the Atlantic Ocean, dynamic ocean processes modify the zonal moisture gradient, therefore increasing the convergence of moisture over that region. Our results highlight the importance of better investigating and monitoring ocean–atmosphere coupling processes to improve our preparedness for future large-scale climate change.

We find that over land and the Pacific Ocean, thermodynamic ocean processes are responsible for the net precipitation increase, while over the Atlantic Ocean the intensification of net precipitation is due to dynamic ocean processes. Our results emphasize that better investigating and monitoring the changes in ocean processes is necessary to better prepare for future climate changes.

## 18. Intraseasonal Variations in Spring East Asian Subtropical Jet: Role of Mid–High Latitude Wave Trains and Influence on Rainfall Anomalies in China

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The spring East Asian subtropical westerly jet (EAWJ) is one of the most crucial atmospheric circulation systems, significantly influencing spring precipitation in China. In this study, by applying the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to the 200-hPa zonal wind anomalies, the first two dominant modes of the spring EAWJ are extracted. The principal components (PCs) of the two EOF modes (PC1 and PC2) exhibit a dominant periodicity of 10–30 days according to the power spectrum analysis results and show significant lead–lag correlations. Therefore, eight phases of the spring EAWJ intraseasonal variations are identified based on the PC1 and PC2, representing the spring EAWJ intraseasonal variability (EAWJ_ISV). Phases 1–4 of EAWJ_ISV exhibit northward EAWJ shifts with positive zonal wind anomalies over Mongolia–Northeast China. The northward-shifted EAWJ can enhance the moisture convergence and ascending motion over the Yangtze–Huai River valley (YHRV) by modulating secondary atmospheric circulation, consequently facilitating more precipitation over the region, and thus increase the probability of extreme precipitation events and regional consecutive cloudy-rainy events (RCCREs). Conversely, phases 5–8 are unfavorable for regional water vapor transport and upward motion, therefore, the spring precipitation intensity over the YHRV is relatively weak, and the probability of extreme precipitation events and RCCREs is also weak. Most rainy days (71.2%) occur in phases 1–4, while dry days (71.3%) occur in phases 5–8. Further analysis indicates that the EAWJ_ISV is influenced by an intraseasonal wave train over mid–high latitude Eurasia from the Ural Mountains to East Asia.

Conversely, phases 5–8 weaken water vapor transport and upward motion, reducing YHRV precipitation intensity and extreme events. For each phase of the EAWJ_ISV, there is a well-organized wave train that propagates southeastward from the Ural Mountains to East Asia. Such a result indicates that the EAWJ_ISV is influenced by the intraseasonal wave train over mid–high latitude Eurasia.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  
                    Subtropical highs are large-scale dominant weather systems with significant impacts on regional climate and weather patterns. However, their cross-scale influence on mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) remains insufficiently understood. This study investigates how satellite-observed MCS characteristics vary with the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) over southeastern mainland China (SEMC), where the WPSH exerts a most frequent influence within the Asian continent. In 7-yr warm seasons, 725 WPSH days were identified and objectively classified into distinct weather types categorized as either WPSH-periphery or WPSH-center patterns, based on SEMC’s location relative to the WPSH. Although MCSs are generally less frequent in the WPSH-center patterns than in the WPSH-periphery ones, their occurrence remains noteworthy near regional hotspots. Across all patterns, MCS occurrence consistently exhibits a diurnal peak in late afternoon and early evening. The WPSH-center patterns show a larger diurnal amplitude with more intensive MCS activity around this peak period. MCSs in the WPSH-center patterns tend to have shorter lifetimes, fewer merging/splitting processes, and a greater tendency to form locally over SEMC in the afternoon. Despite varying movement directions and orientations, MCSs across different patterns generally move along their orientation to facilitate the MCS “training” effect, especially in the WPSH-center patterns due to slower moving speeds and stronger intensities. The analysis on atmospheric conditions suggests that MCS occurrence in the WPSH-periphery patterns is more closely linked to synoptic disturbances, including enhanced moisture transport via low-level jet streams and midlevel upward motion. The convective parameters including convective available potential energy (CAPE), total column water, and

                    index effectively differentiate MCS-active days from MCS-inactive days for each WPSH pattern.

                    This study examines how mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) behave in response to variations in the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) over southeastern mainland China (SEMC). The results reveal distinct characteristics of MCSs occurring at the WPSH center versus its periphery over SEMC. MCSs at the WPSH center are overall less frequent than those at the periphery, but they exhibit a stronger diurnal cycle with more concentrated occurrence around the active period and a higher potential to produce localized heavy rainfall due to slower movement and stronger intensity. Unlike the WPSH-periphery patterns, MCSs at the WPSH-center patterns often occur in weak synoptic-forcing environments of poor predictability. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for MCSs in both WPSH scenarios in forecasting, particularly as the WPSH expands under global warming, influencing future MCS trends.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Projected changes in summer heatwave variability over North America (NA) are examined using a multimodel ensemble of 32 global climate models (GCMs), including three models with 30-member initial-condition ensembles, under the shared socioeconomic pathway 5-8.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario. Applying the common empirical orthogonal function (EOF) approach, two distinct modes of heatwave variability are identified for a historical (1961–2010) and future (2051–2100) period, collectively explaining ∼30% of variability in each period. Spatial patterns of these modes differ between the periods, with significant regional changes detected regarding the variability across GCMs. Prominent North Pacific-to-North America (NA) wave trains, linked to the distinct modes, are evident in tropospheric geopotential and mean sea level pressure anomalies. These wave trains significantly weaken in future projections, reflecting a decline in large-scale dynamic processes. However, enhanced thermodynamic influences on these modes become apparent over the North Pacific and NA in the future. At the regional scale over NA, dynamically driven changes in cloud cover and shortwave downward radiation weaken, while thermodynamically driven changes in moisture availability and longwave downward radiation strengthen, reshaping energy balance and heat redistribution associated with heatwave variability. Consequently, surface radiation heating, the sum of shortwave and longwave radiation, emerges as the most influential variable for explaining changes in the distinct modes of heatwave variability between the periods. Internal variability, assessed using initial-condition ensembles, is comparable to model structure uncertainty in both large-scale and regional dynamic and thermodynamic processes that drive heatwave variability across the periods.

                    Understanding how heatwaves and their associated dynamic and thermodynamic processes will evolve is essential for climate impact assessments. This study identifies distinct modes of summer heatwave variability over North America and reveals shifts in their drivers by 2100. While large-scale and regional dynamic processes that shape heatwaves weaken, thermodynamic influences—particularly changes in moisture availability and longwave radiation—become more dominant in the future. These findings highlight a fundamental shift in the physical mechanisms controlling heatwave variability, emphasizing the increasing role of surface radiation heating. By evaluating multiple climate models and internal variability, this study provides robust evidence of future changes in heatwave variability and its drivers, offering insights to improve projections of extreme events.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) has experienced pronounced warming trends in recent decades, with dynamical processes recognized as key drivers. However, the role of thermal processes remains uncertain due to discrepancies in surface-wind-induced heat flux across existing datasets. The present study introduces a random forest machine learning algorithm that synergistically integrates the advantages of in situ observations and satellite data, yielding a monthly surface wind [machine learning–assisted wind (MLAWind)] dataset and corresponding air–sea heat flux from 1950 to 2022 with a horizontal resolution of 1° × 1°. The MLAWind exhibits high accuracy and robust generalization capability based on evaluations using both satellite and buoy observations. Besides, it is capable of effectively representing spatial and temporal characteristics of surface wind. In contrast to the majority of existing reanalysis datasets, MLAWind reveals a decline in surface wind over the TIO since 1950, which is further supported by the west–east asymmetrical variations in sea surface height and thermocline depth. The attenuation of surface wind is more significant in the eastern TIO as compared to the western TIO, leading to a remarkable reduction in evaporative cooling within the eastern TIO. The thermal processes associated with surface-wind-induced heat flux serve as the essential drivers of the warming in the eastern TIO, with a contribution accounting for approximately 45% of that of dynamical processes. The findings of our study challenge existing reanalysis results but are aligned with state-of-the-art models, highlighting that the significance of thermal processes is substantially underestimated in most existing reanalysis datasets.

                    This study aims to identify the drivers of the significant warming of the tropical Indian Ocean in recent decades. This is important because the underlying mechanisms remain controversial due to uncertainties in existing datasets. We employ a machine learning algorithm to generate a reliable surface wind dataset that combines the advantages of in situ observations and satellite data. Our findings obtained from this dataset reveal that the role of turbulent heat exchange associated with surface winds has been overlooked in most reanalysis datasets.

## 22. A Critical Role for North Pacific Meridional Mode in the ENSO Response to Orbital Precession

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Orbital precession modifies the intensity of the annual cycle at millennial time scales and is a major external driver of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability in both proxy records and climate model simulations. We examine precession’s influence on ENSO through a subtropical pathway, the Pacific meridional mode (PMM), using a suite of NCAR Community Earth System Model, version 1.2 (CESM1.2), experiments that simulate five precessional extremes: perihelion at autumnal equinox (AE), winter solstice (WS), vernal equinox (VE), summer solstice (SS), and zero eccentricity (E0). We investigate mechanisms that may moderate the PMM’s influence on ENSO such as the strength of midlatitude stochastic forcing via the North Pacific Oscillation, changes in the climatological mean state, and the wind–evaporation–sea surface temperature (SST) (WES) feedback. We find that orbital precession strongly influences PMM variability, the PMM’s ability to trigger El Niño events, and ENSO diversity. Precessional extremes characterized by a more southerly intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and stronger trade winds (WS and AE) have more variable PMM behavior and a PMM that is more effective at triggering El Niño events, particularly central Pacific events. Precessional extremes characterized by a more northerly ITCZ and weaker trade winds (SS and VE) have reduced PMM variability and a PMM that is a less-reliable precursor to El Niño events. The PMM response to precession is driven by variations in surface wind fields that moderate the strength of WES feedback, the mechanism by which PMM anomalies grow and propagate. Understanding the sensitivity of ENSO to subtle shifts in the mean state contextualizes past variability and aids in anticipating future change.

                    <jats:title>Significance Statement</jats:title>
                    Orbital precession alters the seasonal distribution of solar insolation around Earth and has vast impacts on the climate system including El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here, we examine how precession influences ENSO through a subtropical ENSO precursor: the Pacific meridional mode (PMM). We use climate models to test how the influence of warm PMM events on El Niño events may vary under extreme states of orbital precession. We find precession moderates the variability of the PMM, the ability of the PMM to trigger El Niño events, and the spatial diversity of El Niño events. These results help us to interpret past climatic changes and understand the sensitivity of the tropical Pacific to small variations in external forcing.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  
                    Southern Ocean mode waters act as a major sink for both anthropogenic heat and carbon, yet the mechanistic understanding of their variability remains incomplete. We use observation-based data to examine an oceanic pathway that begins at the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF), extends through the South Equatorial Current and Agulhas Current, and ultimately encircles the Southern Ocean via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Our analysis reveals that interannual temperature–salinity variations observed in the ITF region propagate into the Southern Ocean along this pathway, taking approximately 3 years to propagate from the Indonesian Archipelago to the Agulhas Retroflection region. Lagrangian particle tracking reveals that both Agulhas Current waters and waters from the Atlantic and further poleward shape the temperature–salinity characteristics of ACC waters in the western Indian Ocean, although the relative contributions of these oceanic pathways and atmospheric forcings have yet to be quantified. In the western Indian Ocean, mixed-layer depth (MLD) and Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) volume and temperature–salinity properties all show strong quasi-biennial variability. These anomalies are advected eastward with the ACC as vertically coherent structures extending over the top 1000 m, reemerging in the eastern Indian Ocean approximately 1 year later, reaching the southeast Pacific in 4–5 years and further to the east of Drake Passage a year afterward. The propagation speed of these anomalies is around 40°–55° longitude per year along the ACC, or equivalently 0.15–0.2 m s
                    <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>
                    , matching the advective speed of water particles driven by mean geostrophic currents in the ACC. In specific years, the eastward advection of anomalies can complete a full circumpolar circuit around the Southern Ocean.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  This study investigates climatological interseasonal changes in the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO)’s propagation diversity using observational data and climate model simulations, with a particular focus on the role of the mean state. In observations, the ratio of the relative frequency of the fast-propagating MJO to that of the slow-propagating MJO shows notable changes from winter to early spring, with a significantly higher ratio during March–April (MA) than during November–February (NDJF). Column-integrated moisture budget analysis reveals that moisture recharge and discharge around the Maritime Continent, which drive the MJO’s eastward propagation, are stronger in MA, with zonally broader and stronger positive moisture tendency to the east of enhanced convection. Further analysis shows that stronger zonal moisture advection is responsible for the enhanced moistening in MA, which differs from NDJF, largely due to the steeper background zonal moisture gradient. The interseasonal difference in the moisture gradient between MA and NDJF appears to be associated with the Australian monsoon. Among the global climate models analyzed, those that better capture the interseasonal changes in zonal moisture gradients around the Maritime Continent tend to also better simulate the interseasonal difference between MA and NDJF in the relative frequency of slow- and fast-propagating MJOs. The model bias in the mean state moisture gradient seems to be caused by a delayed phase transition of the Australian monsoon. Our results suggest that reducing these biases can enhance model performance in simulating the interseasonal changes in the MJO propagation characteristics.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Southern South America is an important dust source to Antarctica. However, there is a lack of overall understanding of the dust event variation in recent decades in South America. Here, we analyzed variations in the dust frequency in southern South America (south of 20°S) from 1986 to 2020 and its causes with large-scale climatic factors, based on observational station data and reanalysis data. During the austral spring and summer, several stations recorded an average dust frequency exceeding 15 days, with some even surpassing 20 days. The frequency of dust events in spring exhibited a strong association with large-scale climate factors. Negative phases of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) were more likely to lead to an increase in the dust frequency in southern South America. The negative IPO had a greater impact on the Patagonia dust (south of 40°S), resulted from a decrease in the drought index under the influence of downward motion. However, the negative AAO had a greater impact on the dust in South America over 20°–40°S by increasing strong wind frequency and decreasing the drought index over there. On longer time scales, model outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) also confirmed the combined influence of the negative IPO and negative AAO phases on southern South American dust.

                    It has been shown that dust from South America can be transported to Antarctica through atmospheric circulation. Changes in dust activity in South America have an important impact on the Antarctic climate. Therefore, this study analyzed the changes in dust activity in southern South America from 1986 to 2020. Since large-scale climate factors such as the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) can play an important role in the regional climate, we analyzed the effects of the IPO and the AAO on the South American dust activity and discussed the possible influence mechanisms. This paper will provide some references for understanding dust activity variation in South America and studying dust transport from South America to Antarctica.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Tropical cyclone (TC)-induced cold wakes play a crucial role in regulating TC precipitation (TCP). However, the influence of air–sea coupling on TCP under global warming remains unclear. This study investigates the potential impact of air–sea interactions on TCP using coupled and uncoupled experiments under a future global warming scenario. Results indicate that cold wakes suppress precipitation in the TC inner-core region (∼300 km). Associated with global warming, the TCs’ cold wakes are progressively strengthened, leading to a more pronounced reduction in inner-core precipitation. Two dominate pathways are revealed by moisture budget analysis as responsible for the changes in TCP. The first is the direct modulation of TCP by cold wakes through their control over evaporation via air–sea interactions. The second is an indirect effect by weakening the TC intensity, thereby reducing moisture convergence and further suppressing TCP. The relative contributions of these two pathways depend on the time scale considered. In the future mean state, cold wakes reduce TCP by equally suppressing evaporation and decreasing moisture convergence through weakened TC intensity. The strengthening cold wakes under global warming lead to an amplifying trend of relative TCP decrease. These findings improve our understanding of air–sea interactions in shaping future TCP, offering valuable insights for enhancing climate projections and disaster preparedness.

## 27. Quantifying Local Radiative Feedbacks at the Sea Surface

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) change, which is important in determining Earth’s energy budget under climate change, disagrees in observations and simulations. The spatial inhomogeneity of local feedback has been identified as an important contributor to the evolution of the SST pattern; however, traditional regression methods are inaccurate in quantifying local feedbacks in the tropics. In this paper, we quantify the magnitude of local feedbacks at the sea surface using SST patch perturbation experiments, with a comparison of the results with those calculated using simple linear regression. The spatial patterns of local feedbacks calculated from these two methods are generally consistent, while the regression method is inaccurate for tropical latent heat and sensible heat feedbacks. The results show that local feedback at the sea surface is consistently negative, which prevents the SST from experiencing unlimited warming. Tropical ascent regions show the strongest negative local feedback in both zonal and meridional directions, and local latent heat feedback and cloud radiative feedback are the most important contributors to the spatial inhomogeneity of surface feedback. Local radiative feedbacks calculated using linear regression are consistent in simulations and observations, and the spatial pattern of local feedbacks is also consistent with the future SST change pattern predicted by climate models, indicating that the El Niño–like future SST change pattern projected by climate models is likely plausible. However, climate models appear to overestimate the negative local radiative feedback compared to reanalysis and observation-based satellite data, which might potentially contribute to the differences between observed and model-simulated SST change patterns during the last several decades.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Climate is a key driver of spatiotemporal variability in wildfire regimes. Increasingly warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns are linked to an increase in fire danger across the world. There is therefore a need to develop the most reliable projections of future climate-driven fire danger to enable decision-makers and forest managers to prepare for and respond to future fire events. Earth system model (ESM) simulations are the foundation for understanding future changes in fire-conducive weather associated with a warming world. Fire weather projections have typically been expressed by a single model or through a multimodel mean, with the models’ relative strengths and weaknesses rarely taken into consideration. This study presents a novel set of future scenarios in fire-prone conditions, defined by the fire weather index, using a statistical weighting approach that specifically accounts for the performance and interdependence of 26 ESMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). When compared with reanalysis-derived data from 1980 to 2014, the weighting approach substantially reduces multimodel bias, thereby demonstrating its added value in accounting for and reducing model uncertainties. The weighted projections reveal significant increases in seasonal fire weather conditions across 68%–91% of the world’s fire-prone area by the end of the twenty-first century, depending on the emission scenario. Additionally, at least 55% of fire-prone area is expected to be associated with a significant increase in fire weather conditions by 2040. The conclusions highlight the potential benefit to targeted prevention strategies and long-term fire management.

                    This study aims to assess future changes in fire danger driven by climate conditions under different climate change scenarios. The results show an overall increase both in magnitude and geographical expansion in the weather conditions enabling ignition and spread of fires. The value of the results lies in the use of a weighted multimodel ensemble mean, reducing climate model biases with respect to reanalysis data in comparison to previous fire danger studies. This is important to better target areas of the world that are, and will very likely be, at higher fire risk in the coming years.

## 29. Epochal Westerly Changes Driven by Shifts in Anthropogenic Aerosol Emissions across Eurasia since 1940

**DOI**: [10.1175/jcli-d-25-0125.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-25-0125.1)

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The Eurasian subtropical westerly jet (ESWJ) is closely related to regional climate changes, such as heat waves over Eurasia. While the weakening of the ESWJ in summer since 1979 has been documented, earlier variations prior to the satellite era remain poorly understood. Here, using both reanalysis datasets and radiosonde observations, along with climate model simulations, we examine ESWJ changes from 1940 to 2020 and find that its post-1979 weakening is only part of a broader interdecadal shift driven by the time-evolving sulfate aerosol distributions. This epochal shift in the ESWJ further led to a transition from decreasing to increasing trends in heat wave durations across Eurasia in the late 1970s. Before 1979, extensive sulfate emissions in Eurasia modulated the tropospheric temperature structure, leading to increased wind speeds along and south of the jet axis (∼40°N). After 1979, reductions in sulfate aerosols over Europe and increased concentrations in Asia contributed to the weakening of the ESWJ. Additionally, moist adiabatic processes in the tropics, driven by rising greenhouse gas concentrations, favored an increase in ESWJ strength during both periods, partially offsetting the weakening induced by anthropogenic aerosol forcing after 1979. Our results highlight the crucial role of the time-evolving distribution of sulfate aerosols associated with different paces of industrial development across the Eurasian countries in driving the epochal westerly changes since the early twentieth century.

                    <jats:title>Significance Statement</jats:title>
                    The Eurasian subtropical westerly jet (ESWJ) plays a critical role in modulating climate and extreme events, but current studies on the ESWJ are limited to the satellite era. This study extends the analysis to 1940 and reveals that the observed weakening of the ESWJ since the beginning of the satellite era is only part of broader interdecadal changes driven by time-evolving sulfate aerosol distributions. Before 1979, extensive sulfate emissions strengthened the ESWJ, whereas the reduction of sulfate aerosols in Europe and increased aerosols in Asia contributed to its weakening since 1979. These findings underscore the complex interactions between anthropogenic aerosol distributions over different regions of Eurasia, westerly jet variability, and heat wave persistence.

                    Profiles of radiative fluxes simulated from thermodynamic and cloud observations made at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) eastern North Atlantic (ENA) site for a 6-yr period are termed as ENARad. ENARad radiative fluxes are compared to those from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) 1°-resolution synoptic product (SYN1deg)-simulated radiative flux profiles as well as the CERES instrument observed top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) fluxes and ground site broadband radiometer measurements. Monthly average differences between ENARad and surface radiometer reported fluxes and differences between ENARad, SYN1deg, and observed fluxes at TOA were statistically insignificant. SYN1deg significantly overestimated surface downwelling shortwave flux by 12 ± 52 W m
                    <jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>
                    and surface downwelling longwave flux by 5 ± 20 W m
                    <jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>
                    on monthly time scales. Such overestimations were traced to a moister and warmer subcloud layer, a drier cloud layer, and a moister and colder above-cloud-free troposphere in the ancillary thermodynamic and cloud properties used by SYN1deg than observed. Similarly, low-cloud coverage, boundaries, and liquid water paths utilized by SYN1deg were also significantly higher than observed. Intramodel differences in the hourly values of shortwave fluxes exceeded 100 W m
                    <jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>
                    at the TOA and the surface. These differences were also due to inaccuracies in the representation of low-cloud properties within the SYN1deg product relative to those determined by ENA ARM instrumentation and used as ENARad ancillary data. Results presented are relevant to investigations employing the CERES SYN1deg data product, studies that estimate radiative fluxes from surface-based or satellite-borne observations, and comparative analyses of radiative fluxes derived using different methodological approaches.

## 32. Robust High-Precision Time Synchronization for Distributed Sensor Systems in Challenging Environments

**发表日期**: 2025-11-14

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223715](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223715)

**摘要**:

Timing and time synchronization are critical capabilities of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), but their performance deteriorates significantly in challenging environments like urban canyons and tunnels. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Distributed Sensor Time Synchronization architecture (DSTS), a novel architecture integrating Bayesian filtering with deep reinforcement learning. DSTS utilizes Bayesian filtering to fuse Time-of-Flight (ToF) measurements with Channel Impulse Response features for real-time compensation of non-linear errors and accurate path state prediction. Concurrently, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm trains each node into an intelligent agent that dynamically learns optimal synchronization weights based on local information like neighbor clock stability and link quality. This allows the architecture to adaptively amplify reliable nodes while mitigating the negative effects of unstable peers and adverse channels, ensuring high accuracy and availability. Simulation experiments based on a real-world UWB dataset demonstrate the architecture’s exceptional performance. The Bayesian filtering module effectively mitigates non-linear errors, reducing the standard deviation of ToF measurements in NLOS scenarios by up to 51.6% (over 41.2% consistently) while achieving high path state prediction accuracy (&gt;85% static, &gt;95% simulated dynamic). In simulated dynamic and heterogeneous networks, the DDPG algorithm achieves a synchronization accuracy better than traditional average-consensus algorithms, ultimately reaching a frequency and phase precision of 4×10−10 and 5×10−10 s, respectively.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The Emirates Mars Mission carries the Emirates eXploration Imager instrument, which captured hourly images on 15 and 24 September 2024. That is equivalent to Martian Year 37, solar longitude 329° and 335°, respectively. These observations recorded two nearly identical dust storms in the Amazonis/Arcadia region. We analyze the hour‐by‐hour evolution of both dust storms, using seven to eight unique images each. We track the onset and growth of the dust storms from around 10 through 16 local true solar time. We also analyze nearby water‐ice clouds and discuss large‐scale meteorological conditions. Both dust storms start in late morning, in or near the warm sector of a low pressure system. There is no evidence that the dust storms form directly on the associated cold front. There are different scenarios how dust storms form and develop. We show a specific scenario for two dust storms.

                    The El Niño of 2023–2024 ranked among the top 5 strongest El Niño events of the past 70 years, yet wintertime atmospheric teleconnections to the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere were markedly weaker than anticipated. Here, we conduct a series of atmospheric modeling experiments using prescribed observed SSTs and radiative forcings to test the hypothesis that the observed pattern of background SST trends since 1980 was responsible for counteracting the expected teleconnection response. This so-called “SST pattern effect” (enhanced warming in the Tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans and relative cooling in the eastern tropical Pacific) is shown to drive a teleconnection of the opposite sign

The circulation response to the 2023–2024 El Niño in the absence of background SST changes is almost entirely cancelled by the teleconnection produced by SST trends, with consequences for precipitation impacts over North America and Europe. Analogous behavior is found for the observed circulation anomalies, although internal atmospheric variability may also contribute. The results underscore the importance of considering the modulating influence of background SST trends, both natural and anthropogenic in origin, on El Niño teleconnections and associated climate impacts in the coming decades.

**摘要**:

Abstract. CIBUSmod 25.09 is an open-source, spatially disaggregated biophysical model designed to evaluate resource use and environmental impacts in agri-food systems on national and sub-national level under future scenarios involving changes in demand and agricultural production systems. It provides a flexible, modular framework that can integrate regionalised data on crop and livestock production systems at the spatial resolution and aggregation level available. In the model agricultural production is distributed regionally to meet an exogenous demand, while enforcing several constraints that ensure internally consistent scenarios that are biophysically and agronomically feasible. Using Sweden as a case study, the model's application is demonstrated by constructing and validating a baseline and conducting a scenario analysis. The results highlight CIBUSmod's ability to quantify trade-offs in land use, nutrient flows, and greenhouse gas emissions across different transition pathways. The model is designed to be accessible, utilising Python and Jupyter Notebooks with Excel-based input data management. It is publicly available under the GNU GPLv3 licence. By enhancing transparency and usability in food systems modelling, CIBUSmod serves as a valuable tool for researchers to explore sustainable agri-food systems transitions at national and sub-national scales.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223716](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223716)

**摘要**:

Reliable global turbidity monitoring is crucial for water resource management, yet existing satellite-based methods face limitations in accuracy, generalization, and scalability across diverse aquatic environments. This study presents a robust, globally applicable turbidity estimation model using Sentinel-2 imagery and a machine-learning approach, developed based on harmonized global open-source datasets (GLORIA and MAGEST; turbidity range: 0–2200 FNU) encompassing 68 lakes, 2 rivers, 2 estuaries, and 11 coastal oceans across 17 countries. Among the evaluated machine-learning models, gradient boosting regression demonstrated the best performance, achieving a high correlation (r: 0.95) with minimal bias (1.32 FNU) and robust generalization across all water types, outperforming existing turbidity models when evaluated on the same test dataset. Shapley Additive exPlanations-based model interpretability identified the Rrs865/Rrs560 ratio as the dominant predictor, with critical contributions from Rrs783, Rrs665, and Rrs865. The model’s performance is evaluated across various optical water types and aquatic systems in diverse geographical settings, showcasing its robustness in sediment-rich and highly turbid environments that underscores its suitability for reliable turbidity monitoring after severe storms or extreme precipitation. Additionally, innovative automated pipelines integrated within a scientific exploitation platform facilitate scalable and near-real-time operational monitoring. This methodological integration provides a significant advancement in satellite-based turbidity monitoring, enabling informed water quality management under diverse environmental and climatic conditions.

**摘要**:

Carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies are increasingly recognised as critical components of global climate mitigation strategies. However, the effective monitoring and verification of greenhouse gas emission reductions from carbon capture, utilisation and storage facilities remain significant challenges. This review synthesises current monitoring methods, including in situ sensing, drone-based observations and satellite remote sensing, and critically evaluates their strengths, limitations and applicability to various carbon capture, utilisation and storage contexts. We analyse the regulatory frameworks that govern monitoring practices across jurisdictions, identify methodological gaps and assess the performance of existing technologies with respect to detection thresholds, the integration of multiple data sources and the requirements for long-term verification. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of data assimilation and inversion modelling in interpreting measurements and quantifying emissions. Based on this synthesis, we recommend a more harmonised, concentration-based approach to monitoring that combines diverse observation platforms to enhance the accuracy, transparency and cost-effectiveness of verification efforts. This review aims to support the development of best practices for environmental monitoring and assessment in the context of carbon capture, utilisation and storage deployment.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Real‐time prediction of dike behavior during an eruption remains a significant challenge. Determining the timing and location of dike propagation arrest is crucial for hazard evaluation. The inherent complexity of eruptive phenomena makes rapid, unambiguous interpretation through modeling difficult. To overcome this drawback, identifying observables that can rapidly support prediction and decision‐making is crucial. For Etna volcano, we have moved in this direction by focusing on seismological observables, aiming to facilitate quick predictions and informed decisions. We have identified the presence of reverse focal mechanisms during the final stage of dike intrusion as a key observable that accompanies and distinguishes potential propagation arrest. This study examines the four critical case studies of dike arrest occurred in 1989, 2002, 2008, and 2018 during lateral intrusions at Mount Etna. The proposed approach proves to be a valuable tool for assessing dike propagation hazards during the early stages of an eruptive intrusion.

**摘要**:

Global soil moisture has undergone significant changes in recent decades due to climate change and vegetation greening. However, the seasonal and climate zonal variations in soil moisture dynamics at different depths, driven by both climate and vegetation, remain insufficiently explored. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the global patterns in rootzone and surface soil moisture and leaf area index (LAI) across different seasons and climate zones, utilizing satellite observations from 1982 to 2020. We investigate how climatic factors and LAI influence soil moisture variations and quantify their dominant contributions. Furthermore, by employing key vegetation phenological indicators, namely the peak of growing season (POS) and the corresponding maximum LAI (LAIMAX), we assess the feedback effects of vegetation phenology on soil moisture dynamics. The results indicate that the greening trend (as reflected by LAI increases) from 2000 to 2020 was significantly stronger than that observed during 1982–1999 across all seasons and climate zones. Both rootzone and surface soil moisture shifted from a decreasing (drying) trend (1982–1999) to an increasing (wetting) trend (2000–2020). From 1982 to 2020, the LAI induced moistening trends in both surface and rootzone soil moisture. In arid and temperate zones, precipitation drove rootzone soil moisture increases only during the summer. Among all seasons and climate zones, solar radiation induced the strongest surface soil drying in tropical summers, with a rate of −0.04 × 10−3 m3m−3/Wm−2. For rootzone soil moisture, LAI dominated over individual climatic factors in winter and spring globally. In contrast, solar radiation became the primary driver during summer and autumn, followed by precipitation. For surface soil moisture, precipitation exhibited the strongest control in winter, but solar radiation surpassed it as the dominant factor from spring through autumn. In the tropical autumn, the sensitivity of rootzone and surface soil moisture to POS (and LAIMAX) was highest, at 0.059 m3m−3·d−1 (0.256 m3m−3/m2m−2) and 0.052 m3m−3·d−1 (0.232 m3m−3/m2m−2), respectively. This research deepens the understanding of how climate and vegetation regulate soil moisture across different climate zones and seasons. It also provides a scientific basis for improving global soil moisture prediction models and managing water resource risks in the context of climate change.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The upper layers of Jupiter's atmosphere, offering critical insights into the planet's deeper structure, are accessible through radio occultation experiments. Since July 2023, NASA's Juno extended mission has provided the first high‐resolution radio occultation measurements since the Voyager era, probing the thermal structure and composition down to approximately 0.5 bar. We use these measurements to study Jupiter's latitudinally dependent vertical thermal structure. We observe cooler stratospheric and warmer tropospheric temperatures at the equatorial region compared to mid‐ and high‐latitudes, and temporal variations in the North Equatorial Belt's thermal structure on a time scale of a few months. These observations align with archival mid‐infrared data from Cassini's CIRS and current ground‐based Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph observations, as well as previous studies based on Voyager radio occultations and the Galileo probe, offering an enhanced view of Jupiter's lower stratosphere and upper troposphere thermal structure.

## 46. The significant role of snow in shaping alpine treeline responses in modelled boreal forests

**摘要**:

Abstract. Treelines across the Northern Hemisphere are shifting upward and northward in response to global warming, particularly in boreal forests, where climate change progresses more rapidly at high elevations and latitudes. These shifts intensify competition for resources, threaten endemic alpine species, and disrupt established ecological relationships, leading to biodiversity loss. However, significant heterogeneity and regional variation exist in how treelines respond to environmental changes, with many underlying drivers and constraints still poorly understood. This study aims to enhance understanding of treeline dynamics at three alpine study sites – located in Canada, Russia, and Alaska – and to improve vegetation model predictions under changing climatic conditions. We evaluated the relative impact of key factors influencing treeline migration velocity and examined the effects of varying snow regimes on treeline migration within the alpine treeline ecotone. To achieve this, we incorporated a novel snow module into the vegetation model LAVESI (Larix Vegetation Simulator), enabling the integration of precipitation outside the growing season, snow accumulation, and snowmelt processes. This module allows for explicit modelling of the positive and negative impacts of snow depth on tree growth and treeline migration, while accounting for stochastically occurring extreme events and capturing full weather variability. Our findings reveal site-specific responses to factors driving treeline shifts and forest expansion, with localised conditions playing a critical role in shaping migration dynamics. The Canadian and the Russian sites demonstrate clear insights into primary migration drivers, while the high variability at the Alaskan site indicates more complex local dynamics and greater predictive uncertainty. The study highlights the significant role of snow in modulating migration potential, as snow accumulation creates favourable conditions for seedling germination and growth while also posing risks of increased mortality from snow loads or avalanches. These results underscore the importance of incorporating snow-related processes into vegetation models to improve the accuracy of predictions for boreal forest dynamics. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into tree migration processes, highlighting the varied predictability of treeline responses across regions. These findings carry significant implications for refining vegetation models and guiding conservation strategies to sustain alpine tundra resilience in the face of accelerating climate change.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223719](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223719)

**摘要**:

Space-based imaging spectrometers that monitor the Earth’s surface generate vast amounts of data, the processing of which requires fast and accurate retrieval algorithms. Estimating scientifically relevant surface properties from remotely measured radiance data typically involves first inferring spectral surface reflectance from the observed radiance, followed by discipline-specific algorithms to derive scientifically relevant properties. Probabilistic reflectance retrieval algorithms, such as the commonly used optimal estimation (OE), are computationally expensive. Furthermore, the Gaussian assumptions associated with OE have not been fully validated in the context of hyperspectral retrievals. To address these challenges, we introduce accelerated optimal estimation (AOE), a Bayesian algorithm that speeds up the OE reflectance inversion process by up to two orders of magnitude compared to a reference OE implementation (ROE), while also providing improved convergence over a number of selected test targets. We also demonstrate that, under given atmospheric conditions, Gaussian uncertainty estimates from OE-type algorithms are accurate. This is achieved by comparing the OE-type posterior distributions to non-Gaussian ones obtained with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Finally, we demonstrate how AOE scales to a larger AVIRIS-NG scene, showcasing its ability to handle complex, large-scale data.

## 48. The Greenland-Ice-Sheet evolution over the last 24 000 years: insights from model simulations evaluated against ice-extent markers

**DOI**: [10.5194/tc-19-5719-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-19-5719-2025)

**摘要**:

Abstract. Continental ice sheets retain a long-term memory stored in their geometry and thermal properties. In Greenland, this creates a disequilibrium with the present climate, as the ice sheet is still adjusting to past changes that occurred over millennial timescales. Data-consistent modelling of the paleo Greenland-Ice-Sheet evolution is thus important for improving model initialisation in future projection experiments. Open questions also remain regarding the ice sheet's former volume, extent, flux, internal flow dynamics, thermal conditions, and how such properties varied in space since the last glaciation. Here, we conduct a modelling experiment that aims to produce simulations in agreement with empirical data on Greenland's ice-margin extent and timing over the last 24 000 years. Given uncertainties in model parameterisations, we apply an ensemble of 100 ice-sheet-wide simulations at 5×5 km resolution using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model, forced by simulations from the isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model. Using a new Greenland-wide reconstruction of former ice margin retreat (PaleoGrIS 1.0), we score each simulation's fit from 24 000 years ago to 1850 AD. The results provide insights into the dynamics, drivers, and spatial heterogeneities of the local Last Glacial Maximum, Late-glacial, and Holocene evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet. For instance, we find that between 16 and 14 thousand years ago, the ice sheet lost most ice grounded on the continental shelf. This marine-sector retreat, associated with mass loss rates up to seven times greater than today's, was likely mainly driven by ocean warming. Our model–data comparison results also show regional heterogeneities in fit and allows estimating agreement-score sensitivity to parameter configurations, which should prove useful for future paleo-ice-sheet modelling studies. Finally, we report remaining model-data misfits in ice extent, here found to be largest in northern, northeastern, and central-eastern Greenland, and discuss possible causes for these.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223709](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223709)

**摘要**:

Management zones (MZs) are a key precision agriculture strategy for managing spatial variability in crops, but conventional delineation methods are costly, time-consuming, and rely on specialized equipment. Previous studies in potato production have primarily relied on single-year NDVI or proximal soil sensor data analyses, limiting their ability to capture temporal stability and variability across multiple fields. This study addresses this gap by applying multi-year, multi-source NDVI composites to characterize spatial and temporal patterns of agricultural potential across 17 commercial potato fields at McCain’s Farm of the Future, Florenceville-Bristol, New Brunswick. A total of 230 NDVI images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 (2015–2023) were processed into composite metrics (mean, standard deviation, skewness) to delineate three agricultural potential (AP) MZs. Validation was conducted using 2023 potato tuber yield and soil physicochemical properties. The results showed statistically significant correlations between NDVI metrics and key soil nutrients (total carbon: |r| &lt; 0.19; total nitrogen: |r| &lt; 0.28), with tuber yield (|r| &lt; 0.41). Spatial patterns of total carbon and nitrogen corresponded with delineated MZs, and tuber yield variability partially aligned with these zones. These findings demonstrate that multi-year NDVI composites provide a cost-effective and scalable approach for mapping agricultural potential, capturing both spatial and temporal variability, and supporting data-driven management decisions in potato production systems.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Reverse time migration based on geometric mean or cross-correlation is a powerful passive-source imaging technique that can produce high-resolution source images even under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. When the velocity model is inaccurate, a hybrid method combining geometric-mean and arithmetic-mean reverse time migration is typically used to reduce sensitivity to model errors. Conventional hybrid methods usually employ a grouping strategy, in which receivers are divided into groups and multiplicative operations are performed between these groups. However, this strategy essentially utilizes only a subset of receiver combinations, which may compromise imaging quality when the number of receivers is insufficient. To overcome this limitation, a novel combinational autocorrelation reverse time migration imaging condition is proposed. Our method forms multiple combinations of receivers and conducts zero-lag autocorrelation on the extrapolated wavefields of these combinations. The cross terms generated by the autocorrelation operation correspond to all possible receiver combinations. Finally, these autocorrelation results are linearly stacked in order to eliminate interference terms while preserving the cross terms. By including more receiver combinations, the proposed method can provide improved imaging performance. Furthermore, due to the adoption of the autocorrelation algorithm, the new method achieves minimal memory usage among methods based on reverse time migration, which makes it especially suitable for three-dimensional problems. Acoustic numerical simulations verify the effectiveness and advantages of the new method in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenarios. Additionally, the mathematical relationship between our method and conventional methods is discussed, clarifying the applicable scope of the new method.

## 51. SAR-Conditioned Consistency Model for Effective Cloud Removal in Remote Sensing Images

**作者**: Qizhuo Han, Bo Huang, Ying Li

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**发表日期**: 2025-11-14

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223721](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223721)

**摘要**:

Cloud contamination, especially thick cloud cover, severely limits the usability of optical remote sensing imagery by obscuring surface information. Due to the strong penetrability of microwave signals, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as an effective source for thick cloud removal. While SAR-assisted deep learning methods, such as CNNs and GANs, have made notable progress, the quality of generated imagery still requires improvement. Diffusion models, which offer strong potential for enhancing generation fidelity, could address this limitation but suffer from slow sampling speeds that constrain practical use and underscore the need for greater efficiency. To simultaneously enhance both reconstruction quality and sampling efficiency, this paper proposes a fast-sampling SAR-conditioned consistency model based on consistency distillation, named CM-CR, which adopts a teacher–student architecture to divide the reconstruction process into a rapid coarse prediction stage and a detailed refinement stage, significantly reducing per-scene processing time while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. Specifically, a SAR-Conditioned Score-Based Diffusion Model (SCSBD) is first developed as the teacher network for learning a SAR-conditioned optical image generation model. Consistency distillation is then used to derive the student network SAR-conditioned consistency model (SCCM), which enables a rapid coarse prediction through single-step sampling. Finally, a Progressive Denoising via Multistep Resampling (PDMSR) strategy is introduced to iteratively refine the single-step output, producing fine-grained reconstructions. Comparative experiments conducted on the widely used cloud removal benchmark dataset SEN12MS-CR demonstrate that the proposed CM-CR method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all image quality metrics. Notably, although its design uses approximately 80 times more parameters compared with a standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), it delivers up to a 40-fold acceleration at inference.

**摘要**:

Understanding the dynamics of terrestrial carbon sources and sinks is crucial for addressing climate change, yet significant uncertainties remain at regional scales. We developed the Monitoring and Evaluation of Greenhouse gAs Flux (MEGA) inversion system with satellite data assimilation and applied it to China using OCO-2 V11.1r XCO2 retrievals. Our results show that China’s terrestrial ecosystems acted as a carbon sink of 0.28 ± 0.15 PgC yr−1 during 2018–2023, consistent with other inversion estimates. Validation against surface CO2 flask measurements demonstrated significant improvement, with RMSE and MAE reduced by 30%–46% and 24–44%, respectively. Six sets of prior sensitivity experiments conclusively demonstrated the robustness of MEGA. In addition, this study is the first to systematically compare model-derived and observation-based background fields in satellite data assimilation. Ten sets of background sensitivity experiments revealed that model-based background fields exhibit superior capability in resolving seasonal flux dynamics, though their performance remains contingent on three key factors: (1) initial fields, (2) flux fields, and (3) flux masks (used to control regional flux switches). These findings highlight the potential for further refinement of the atmospheric inversion system.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is often considered a natural barrier for the northward expansion of the Antarctic sea ice, but the underlying processes remain little explored. Here, we focus on the main fronts of the ACC – as a measure of the current system's path – to study how they influence the mean state of sea ice. We find that the latitude of all ACC fronts as a function of longitude shows a correlation above 0.85 with the climatological mean latitude of the winter sea ice edge, indicating a strong link across all sectors of the Southern Ocean. Among the ACC fronts, the Polar Front is identified as the best indicator for studying the ACC's influence on sea ice, as it marks a distinct transition in upper-ocean water mass properties and is consistently found north of the sea ice edge. The distance between the Polar Front and the sea ice edge decreases when the Polar Front lies farther south, due to the presence of warmer waters at higher latitudes. These warmer waters enable efficient heat transport toward the ice edge and constitute a barrier to sea ice expansion, via two main mechanisms. First, the ocean carries heat from the Polar Front toward the pole, in particular through the contribution of mesoscale ocean eddies formed downstream of major underwater topographic features. Second, warmer oceanic surface waters near the front heat the atmosphere above, which then carries this heat poleward towards the ice, especially in regions with more southward-directed winds. Since the Polar Front's path is largely shaped by topographic barriers, these results indicate why the position of the winter sea ice edge is strongly constrained, under current conditions, by bathymetry.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Accurate prediction of seasonal variations in salinity is essential for assessing the health of estuarine environments. Traditional estuarine salinity models face challenges such as high computational demands and extensive data requirements. Here, we introduce a novel, reduced‐complexity model that computes seasonal variations in estuarine salinity based on three key inputs: river discharge, tidal water levels, and marine salinity. The model predicts the seasonal (monthly moving average) salinity at a given location using a single dimensionless variable that represents the ratio of freshwater discharge to tidally driven discharge. The model is validated using data from 11 estuaries globally, showing strong predictive performance for seasonal salinity time series in each estuary, with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.5 ± 1.3 psu across all estuaries. Moreover, we also show that our reduced‐complexity model predicts seasonal estuarine salinity with comparable accuracy as a fully three‐dimensional Delft3D simulation in one estuary.

**摘要**:

Abstract. This study conducts a statistical analysis of the aurora observed by the Swedish satellite MATS. MATS' main instrument is a telescope that performs limb imaging at six different wavelength intervals, among them the 762 nm wavelength emission in the O2 atmospheric band. This emission, even though it can not be observed from the ground, is important at mesosphere/lower thermosphere altitudes for both atmospheric airglow and aurora. Here, some auroral properties of this emission, such as peak altitude, geomagnetic location, and auroral intensity, are examined and compared to the SME and Kp geomagnetic indices. A total of 378 events are analyzed. An average geomagnetic latitude of 67.7° is found in both hemispheres, and an average peak altitude of 103 km is obtained. The peak altitude shows dependence on the magnetic local time. Auroral intensities of the order of 102–103 kR are observed.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Organic aerosol (OA), a major component of submicron particulate matter (PM1), has significant impacts on both human health and climate. Quantifying its sources is therefore crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Positive matrix factorisation (PMF) applied to aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) mass spectral data offers a robust approach for quantifying OA sources. A year-long study of ACSM data from London's Marylebone Road monitoring station during the COVID-19 pandemic provides insights into the impact of lockdown and the Eat Out To Help Out (EOTHO) scheme, which offered support to the hospitality industry during the pandemic, on PM composition and OA sources. Five OA sources were identified including hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA, traffic-related, 11 % to OA), cooking OA (COA, 20 %), biomass burning OA (BBOA, 12 %), more-oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA, 38 %), and less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA, 21 %). Lockdown significantly reduced HOA (−52 %), COA (−67 %), and BBOA (−42 %) compared to their pre-COVID levels, while EOTHO doubled COA (+100 %) compared to the post-lockdown period. However, MO-OOA and LO-OOA were less affected, as these primarily originated from long-range transport. This research has demonstrated the importance of commercial cooking as a significant source of OA (20 %) and PM1 (9 %) in urban areas. The co-emission of BBOA with COA observed in Central London showed a similar diurnal cycle and response to the EOTHO policy, indicating that cooking activities might be currently underestimated and contribute to urban BBOA. Therefore, more effort is required to quantify this source and develop targeted abatement policies to mitigate emissions as currently limited regulation is in force.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Mars lacks an intrinsic global magnetic field but possesses crustal magnetic anomalies and an atmosphere. Mars' ionosphere, resulted from interactions between Mars' atmosphere and solar radiation, directly interacts with solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). However, the mechanisms governing ion acceleration and escape from Mars' ionosphere remain incompletely understood. By analyzing simultaneous observations from MAVEN and Tianwen‐1 missions, we present observational evidence of magnetic reconnection events in Mars' dayside upper ionosphere above weak crustal field region during IMF rotation, accompanied by acceleration of ionospheric ions. The explosive escape flux exceeds the average plume and tailward escape flux by an order of magnitude and is comparable to that of reconnection processes above strong crustal field regions. Our results provide evidence that IMF rotation‐triggered magnetic reconnection constitutes a significant pathway for ion escape from Mars, offering new insights into planet's atmospheric evolution and potential mechanisms for early water loss on Mars.

                  Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) can significantly impact local environments and further affect surrounding regions when moving out of the TP. However, the characteristics of MCSs with different movement paths and their sub-seasonal variations remain unclear. Based on half-hourly GPM satellite data from 23 warm seasons (2001–2023), this study reveals that the dominant movement paths of MCSs generated over TP are the southeast (SE), northeast (NE) and southwest (SW) paths, accounting for approximately 50%, 30%, and 15% of the total MCSs, respectively. For MCSs dissipating locally (LT-MCSs), eastward-moving MCSs travel faster and exhibit stronger maximum precipitation, while for moving-out MCSs (MT-MCSs), the SW path exhibits the highest strengths in terms of various properties. MCSs generated over the southern (eastern) part of TP tend to move out of TP along the south (east) path, while those in the center TP quickly dissipate. Notably, maximum precipitation increases with the distance away from the TP for MT-MCSs with the SE and SW paths, but decreases for the NE path. Regarding sub-seasonal variations, the occurrences of both MT-MCSs and LT-MCSs increase from May to July and then decrease, and the ratio of MT-MCSs to total MCSs during mid-summer (i.e., July and August) is lower than that during other months. Meanwhile, the number of eastward moving MT-MCSs decreases during mid-summer, accompanied by the westward shift of the high value centers of maximum precipitation, which can be attributed to the sub-seasonal variations of circulation and water vapor transport.

**摘要**:

Abstract. This study investigates the reconstruction of wind-driven currents based on an empirical impulse response function. Surface current observations derived from drifting buoy data and wind-stress from the ERA5 reanalyses are used to derive the response function. The function is expected to be sensitive to the ocean mixed-layer depth and more generally the turbulent viscosity profile which can display strong spatio-temporal variability. In this work, however, only seasonal and meridional variations are considered. Despite this crude approximation, the simplified response function can explain a significant portion of the current variability in independent observations. A practical application is the release of a new total surface current product (denoted WOC). Compared to existing products based on the same input datasets, such as the CMEMS MOB-TAC (Guinehut, 2021) surface current product, the WOC estimates are designed to include higher frequency content, in particular in the inertial band. Beyond successful validation, the characteristics of the response function (amplitudes and phases) reveal interesting properties of the upper-ocean variability. The function shows some similarities to one derived theoretically from a simple 1-layer (slab) model, but also differences that highlight the value of fitting the function to the data without the use of an explicit dynamical model. These results open perspectives for studying some dependencies between subsurface variables and the response function, particularly interesting in the context of future spaceborne Doppler scatterometers such as ODYSEA (Rodríguez et al., 2019), expected to provide simultaneous wind and current observations. This instrument could indirectly probe subsurface properties through the synoptically-observed response function.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The Tianshan is an intracontinental orogenic belt that has experienced over 100 Mw ≥ 6 earthquakes since 1700. However, strain rates and slip deficit rates on mapped faults in this region—key factors in assessing its seismic potential—remain underexplored. Using an updated interseismic Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) velocity field from 936 stations and four geodetic strain models, we compute surface horizontal strain rates and invert them to estimate slip deficit rates on 97 major mapped faults. We find that surface strain is primarily concentrated (∼70%) in the western half of the Tianshan, with ∼60% of the strain across the entire orogen accommodated by the mapped faults. Incorporating historical seismicity, we assess the seismic moment budget and identify 20 fault segments capable of generating future Mw ≥ 7.0 earthquakes.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>
                  In the previous paper of this series, a petrophysical model named the Dynamic Stern Layer (DSL) model was extended to describe induced polarization phenomena associated with permafrost by capturing direct and indirect effects associated with the presence of ice in porous media. In the present paper, time-domain induced polarization data obtained in field conditions are interpreted thanks to this updated DSL model. We selected three different test sites in order to apply the DSL model to very different conditions of low and high ice contents to see how ice content directly and indirectly affects geoelectrical measurements. A first survey is performed along a cross-section of a ridge in the Kangerlussuaq mountains of Greenland (Site I). In this area, the rock corresponds to a Precambrian granite characterized by a rather low (&amp;lt; 5%) porosity and therefore a low ice volumetric content on the North face of the ridge. We do not see any direct ice polarization contribution in the data obtained with a current injection period of 1 s. We also performed a field survey close to Col des Vés (2846 m a.s.l., Tignes, French Alps, Site II). This site corresponds to a complex ground ice body overlying a substratum made of a low-porosity marble, both having high resistivity values. The front of this body is characterized by a small amount of residual ice while the roots are ice-rich. Therefore the porosity at this site is high and the ice content highly variable. This case study showcases the role of ice in the induced polarization data in terms of high chargeability values (close to 1 as predicted by the theory in which ice behaves as a surfacic protonic semi-conductor) at the roots of the complex ground ice body. A third site (Site III) corresponds to a profile crossing the Aiguille du Midi (3842 m a.s.l., Chamonix), also in the French Alps in a low porosity granitic environment. Laboratory experiments are used to interpret the tomograms of the electrical conductivity and normalized chargeability using the DSL model and water content and Cation Exchange Capacity tomograms are reconstructed at these sites. This study demonstrates the ability of induced polarization to be an efficient tool to characterize permafrost in very different field conditions.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Surface soil moisture (SSM) and root‐zone soil moisture (RZSM) play critical roles in shaping heatwaves and droughts, yet their distinct controls remain unclear. Using 46 years of North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 data and event coincidence analysis across the contiguous United States, we demonstrate that SSM primarily drives heatwaves in semiarid and sub‐humid regions (median MaxTCR ≈ 0.63) through rapid surface drying, which shifts energy from latent to sensible heat. During droughts, RZSM has stronger influence in the central Great Plains (MaxTCR ≈ 0.64–0.71) with 3–5 months lags, indicating prolonged control over transpiration, compared with shorter lags (0–1 month; MaxTCR ≈ 0.44) in the Southwest. Analysis of three major events indicates that RZSM depletion intensified extremes in sub‐humid and humid regions by suppressing transpiration and evaporative cooling, whereas sparse vegetation limited these feedbacks in arid regions. Incorporating lagged RZSM data can improve early warning systems for extreme events.

**摘要**:

The Cathedral of San Giorgio, a chief example of Baroque architecture in Sicily (Italy), has been the focus of extensive geophysical investigations aimed at structural and subsoil characterization to support heritage conservation efforts. This study is among the few to apply a high-resolution Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey to the pillars of a Baroque Church, revealing internal structural details not documented in any available historical sources. Using a 2 GHz antenna, parallel radar profiles, spaced 0.05 m apart in both directions, were collected to reconstruct a detailed 3D model of the internal structure. Depth-slice and 3D-view analyses revealed multiple reflector sets corresponding to the different masonry blocks forming the pillars. Distinct internal layers were identified at depths of 0.22–0.30 m and 0.40–0.55 m, indicating blocks approximately 0.20–0.30 m in height and the possible presence of vertical connectors. These results complement previous studies that defined the dynamic parameters of the structure and a 3D velocity model of the subsoil, which suggested anomalies linked to remnants of the ancient Byzantine church of San Nicola. Overall, the findings provide valuable insights into the construction techniques and current condition of the pillars, contributing essential data for the planning of conservation and restoration strategies.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>
                  Modelling induced polarization (IP) effects in electromagnetic (EM) data is increasingly becoming a standard tool in mineral exploration, but the industry standard is still based on one-dimensional (1D) forward and Jacobian modelling. We have developed a three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic forward and inversion method within the EEMverter modelling platform, incorporating IP effects. The 3D computations are performed in the frequency domain using the vector finite element method and then transformed into the time domain via Hankel transformation. This approach enables modeling of any IP parameterization, ranging from the simple constant phase angle model to a full Debye decomposition. Furthermore, 3D forward modeling mesh and inversion mesh are built independently: an Octree forward mesh is designed for efficient spatial segmentation for single or multiple soundings, while the inversion parameters are defined on a structured model mesh, which is linked to the forward meshes via interpolation. In conjunction with the development of a full 3D EM-IP inversion, we introduce a novel 3D inversion workflow. This workflow allows for hybrid 1D-3D computations, both sequentially and spatially, enabling 3D modeling exclusively in the most significant and interesting areas of the survey. We tested the hybrid 1D-3D inversion workflow using airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data acquired by Xcalibur with the HeliTEM system in the Staré Ransko area (Czech Republic), known for its gabbro-peridotite rocks hosting nickel-copper±cobalt, platinum group element (Ni-Cu±Co, PGE) mineralization. The results demonstrate that the hybrid inversion effectively addresses the challenges of 3D modeling on large-scale datasets. It enhances interpretation reliability in regions with strong 3D effects and shows a significant spatial correlation between resistivity and chargeability phase anomalies and known mineral deposits. Moreover, both synthetic and field data indicate that the resistivity parameter is more sensitive to 3D effects than the chargeability phase parameter.

## 74. Influence of subduction history and mineral deformation on seismic anisotropy in the lower mantle

**作者**: Mo Hu, Michael Gurnis, Jennifer M Jackson

**期刊**: Geophysical Journal International

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Seismic observations reveal significant anisotropy in the D″ region, providing direct constraints on mantle flow and deformation. However, the global anisotropy pattern and its relationship with subduction history, mineral deformation, and rheology in the lower mantle remain unclear. We analyze published regional shear-wave splitting and null measurements, along with waveform inversions, which reveal rapid lateral variations in anisotropy near the edges of large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs). We combine mineral physics results of temperature- and pressure-dependent elastic tensors, slip systems, and phase transition mechanisms to explore potential deformation scenarios. We set up models that begin with dynamic thermochemical convection, tracking the deformation history driven by the subduction, evolving crystal fabrics, and cumulative seismic anisotropy. Models show that post-perovskite (pPv) with a (001)-dominant slip system, combined with viscosity changes and texture inheritance during the bridgmanite-post-perovskite (Br-pPv) phase transition and the reverse transition, best reproduces the distinct anisotropy patterns observed in upwelling regions such as plume roots and LLSVP edges. The nominal model is time-dependent, showing strong seismic anisotropy when slabs impinge on the CMB that diminishes toward the LLSVP, followed by plume development at the LLSVP edge with significant anisotropy. Within LLSVPs, internal convective upwellings and downwellings can explain the intermittent, spatially clustered anisotropy. We further demonstrate the potential for constraining LLSVP composition through the observed weaker anisotropy within these structures compared to the surrounding mantle, with our results favoring a Br-rich composition. Computations indicate that the bulk of the lower mantle remains nearly isotropic despite significant texture accumulation through dislocation glide, and that seismic anisotropy can extend several hundred kilometers above the core–mantle boundary.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The response of the Quasi‐Biennial Oscillation to changing concentrations of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, aerosols, and ozone, and also to volcanic eruptions and solar variability, is explored using 65,000 years of model output contributed by four modeling centers to the Large Ensemble Single Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (LESFMIP). The large ensemble size (at least 10, and in many cases 50) allows for the isolation of weak signals that are usually hidden by internal variability. Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations lead to weakening of the Quasi‐biennial Oscillation (QBO) and an increased likelihood of a disruption event, with the effect most pronounced in the lower stratosphere. Increasing aerosols lead to a strengthening of the QBO. Explosive volcanic eruptions lead to a weakening, and for some phases also a stalling, of the QBO. Volcanic eruptions can also help trigger a QBO disruption. The ozone forcing used for LESFMIP helps synchronize the QBO phase across ensemble members, and also increases the strength of the QBO. Finally, the solar forcing has the smallest impact on the QBO of the five forcings. The large ensemble sizes also allow for exploring the QBO phases and the time of year most prone to a QBO disruption: disruptions preferentially occur around 8 months after the phase with easterlies near 50 hPa, and are most common in late boreal winter and early spring.

**摘要**:

Abstract. High Spectral Resolution Lidars (HSRLs) have been successfully deployed from a variety of platforms: ground based, airborne, and now satellite. These lidars are uniquely valuable for characterizing atmospheric aerosol and clouds, benefiting from the ability to characterize vertical variability in more detail than any passive instruments, and, compared to elastic backscatter lidars, provide additional channels of measurements that permit the direct retrieval of particulate extinction. Although analytic solutions exist for deriving particulate backscatter, extinction, and linear depolarization ratio, in the case of extinction, the analytic technique greatly magnifies measurement noise. Low signal-to-noise measurements stress the traditional inversion methods. Accordingly, algorithms for the retrieval of HSRL backscatter and extinction are re-examined and optimized to reduce the noise propagation. Here we explore an Optimal Estimation methodology and compare it with an implementation of the direct differentiation method like that historically used for the processing of airborne HSRL data from NASA Langley Research Center.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Advancing high-resolution Arctic ocean–sea ice modeling is critical for understanding polar amplification and improving climate projections but faces challenges from computational limits and cross-scale interactions. The simulation capabilities of the ocean–sea ice coupled model (E3SMv2-MPAS) from the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) 2.1 for the Arctic ocean–sea ice system are systematically evaluated using multi-source observational data. The model employs a latitudinally varying mesh, with resolution increasing from 60 km in the Southern Hemisphere to 10 km in the Arctic. This design balances computational efficiency with the accurate integration of low-latitude oceanic influences, while the unstructured mesh also enhances the geometric representation of Arctic straits. Together, these features form a simulation framework capable of resolving processes from seasonal to decadal timescales. Numerical results demonstrate E3SMv2-MPAS's superior Arctic simulation performance: (1) accurate reproduction of spatial heterogeneity in sea ice concentration, thickness, and sea surface temperature, including their 1995–2020 trend patterns; (2) faithful reproduction of both the freshwater content and transports through key Arctic gateways; (3) successful reconstruction of three-dimensional thermohaline structures within the Atlantic Water layer, capturing Atlantic Water's decadal warming trends and accelerated Atlantification processes – specifically mid-layer shoaling, heat content amplification, and reduced heat transfer lag times in the Eurasian Basin. Persistent systematic biases are identified: 0.5–1 m sea ice thickness overestimation in the Canadian Basin; Coordinated sea surface temperature/salinity underestimation and sea ice concentration overestimation in the Greenland and Barents Seas; Atlantic Water core temperature overestimation; Regional asymmetries in decadal thermohaline field evolution.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-14

**DOI**: [10.1007/s10994-025-06895-x](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-025-06895-x)

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Time series representation learning is the process of extracting condensed and meaningful representations from raw sequential data, with unsupervised representation learning offering methods to do so without the need for labelled data. Reconstruction-based deep-learning methods are capable of deriving representations from sequential data in an unsupervised setting and offer enhanced interpretability due to their capability of decoding extracted representations; however, these methods often fall short of contrastive-based methods regarding the quality of representations, as the latter utilise contrastive learning to produce representations that are as close as possible in the embedding space for similar samples and far apart for dissimilar ones. We propose Time Series Representations Classroom (TSRC), a framework that leverages knowledge distillation and curriculum learning to combine the interpretability of reconstruction-based methods with the capabilities of contrastive-based methods. This framework consists of a hybrid loss function that combines reconstruction and contrastive losses and a curriculum that guides the learning process. We compare the performance of methods trained within the TSRC framework using the downstream task of time series clustering on 112 datasets from the UCR Archive against the same methods trained without the TSRC framework and 4 baselines from the literature. Our empirical results demonstrate that methods trained within the TSRC framework deliver better results compared to the same methods trained without it, achieving higher average rankings between 6.88% and 17.47% in external cluster evaluation and between 62.15% and 75.07% in internal cluster evaluation. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that models trained using the TSRC framework produce representations that are more transferable, achieving, without additional tuning, on average 14.02% higher average rankings in time series classification compared to the same models trained without the TSRC framework.

## 79. Doomed descent? How fast sulphate signals diffuse in  the EPICA Dome C ice column

**DOI**: [10.5194/tc-19-5693-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-19-5693-2025)

**摘要**:

Abstract. The loss of climate information due to smoothing of ionic impurity signals in ice provides a strong motivation for understanding their diffusion rates at ice-core sites. By analysing sulphate signals in the EPICA Dome C (EDC) core, recent studies estimated the vertical profile of effective diffusivity Deff at that site. However, Deff crudely approximates the local diffusivity D in the ice, it being a nonuniform-weighted average of D over large intervals. We formulate the mathematical inversion for retrieving the D profile from observed signals, which reconciles the findings of the earlier studies as well as elucidating the averaging approximation. Inversion for EDC sulphate reveals a rapid decrease in D through the firn layer – from ≈ 10−6 m2 yr−1 at the surface to ≈ 1.7 × 10−8 m2 yr−1 at the firn-ice transition (≈ 100 m depth, ≈ 2.5 ka), followed by a gradual decline to ≈ 10−10 m2 yr−1 through 100–2700 m (2.5–390 ka). This profile enables new interpretation of sulphate transport in the EDC column. We propose vapour diffusion of H2SO4 through interconnecting air pores as the cause of the high firn diffusivity. By evaluating the mechanisms controlling D below the firn (diffusion through ice crystals, liquid veins and grain boundaries and diffusion arising from interfacial motion), we infer a dominant partitioning of signals immediately below the firn to a connected vein system, and progressive smoothing of vein signals by Gibbs–Thomson diffusion down to ≈ 2000 m depth, which leaves more and more of the remaining signals to grain boundaries. We conclude that those sulphate signals that survive the initial fast diffusion in the firn to “punch through” to its base might survive into deep ice, and that EDC sulphate preserves a strongly filtered history of volcanic and climatic forcing that underrepresents changes and events shorter than a few years. For the Beyond EPICA – Oldest Ice and Million Year Ice Core drilling sites on Little Dome C, calculations assuming a diffusivity profile like our EDC profile and not exceeding 10−10 m2 yr−1 in ice older than 450 ka constrain the sulphate diffusion length in ice 1–2 Ma old to 2 cm at most, and probably as low as ≈ 1 cm, for atmospheric-sourced signals that experienced only diffusion and mechanical shortening in the column.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223708](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223708)

**摘要**:

Unmanned surface vessels may encounter unknown surface obstacles when sailing. Accurate detection has a significant impact on the subsequent decision-making process. In order to deal with the complex water environment, this paper proposes an object detection framework based on the fusion of LiDAR and camera. The detection framework can achieve real-time and accurate water surface object detection without training, and has strong anti-interference ability. The detection framework achieves the data fusion of LiDAR and camera through external calibration and then uses the detection algorithm of sky–sea boundary (SSB) to establish a clear search area for LiDAR. Then, a two-stage clustering algorithm based on point cloud attributes and distribution information achieves more accurate segmentation. The region of interest (RoI) is obtained from the detection results by image projection. Finally, the region of interest is finely segmented by the saliency object detection algorithm. The experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm.

## 82. OptiFusionStack: A Physio-Spatial Stacking Framework for Shallow Water Bathymetry Integrating QAA-Derived Priors and Neighborhood Context

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223712](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223712)

**摘要**:

Conventional pixel-wise satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) models face dual challenges: physical ambiguity from variable water quality and spatial incoherence from ignoring geographic context. This study addresses these limitations by proposing and validating OptiFusionStack, a novel two-stage physio-spatial synergistic framework that operates without in situ optical data for model calibration. The framework first generates diverse, physics-informed predictions by integrating Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA)-derived inherent optical properties (IOPs) with multiple base learners. Critically, it then constructs a multi-scale spatial context by computing neighborhood statistics over an experimentally optimized 9 × 9-pixel window. These physical priors and spatial features are then effectively fused by a StackingMLP meta-learner. Validation in optically diverse environments demonstrates that OptiFusionStack significantly surpasses the performance plateau of pixel-wise methods, elevating inversion accuracy (e.g., R2 elevated from 0.66 to &gt;0.92 in optically complex inland waters). More importantly, the framework substantially reduces spatial artifacts, producing bathymetric maps with superior spatial coherence. A rigorous benchmark against several state-of-the-art, end-to-end deep learning models further confirms the superior performance of our proposed hierarchical fusion architecture in terms of accuracy. This research offers a robust and generalizable new approach for high-fidelity geospatial modeling, particularly under the common real-world constraint of having no in situ data for optical model calibration.

                  This paper presents an analysis of Juno's first radio occultation experiments. Relying on two‐way radio links in the X‐ and Ka‐bands, we processed data from NASA's Deep Space Network antennas through a ray‐tracing inversion algorithm. By effectively isolating dispersive effects, we obtained measurements of the neutral atmosphere's characteristics. This enabled the derivation of pressure and temperature profiles from the recorded frequencies. These results complement prior data from Voyager occultations and CIRS observations, providing valuable contributions to our understanding of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics.

## 84. Leveraging Limited ISMN Soil Moisture Measurements to Develop the HYDRUS-1D Model and Explore the Potential of Remotely Sensed Precipitation for Soil Moisture Estimates in the Northern Territory, Australia

**作者**: Muhammad Usman, Christopher E. Ndehedehe

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223723](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223723)

**摘要**:

Soil moisture plays a key role in the critical zone of the Earth and has extensive value in the understanding of hydrological, agricultural, and environmental processes (among others). Long-term (in situ) monitoring of soil moisture measurements is generally not practical; however, short-term measurements are often found. Limited soil moisture measurements can be employed to develop a numerical model for long-term and accurate soil moisture estimations. A key input variable to the model is precipitation, which is also not easily accessible, particularly at a finer spatial resolution; hence, publicly available remote sensing data can be used as an alternative. This study, therefore, aims to develop a numerical model HYDRUS-1D to estimate soil moisture in the data-scarce state of the Northern Territory, Australia, with a land cover of shrubland and a Tropical-Savannah type climate. The HDYRUS-1D is based on the numerical solution of Richards’ equation of variably saturated flow that relies on information about the soil water retention characteristics. This study utilized the van Genuchten model parameters, which were optimized (against measured soil moisture) through parameter optimization with initial estimates obtained from the HYDRUS catalogue. Initial estimates from different sources can differ for the same soil texture (e.g., loamy sand) and can induce uncertainties in the calibrated model. Therefore, a comprehensive uncertainty analysis was conducted to address potential uncertainties in the calibration process. The HYDRUS-1D was calibrated for a period between March 2012 and February 2013 and was independently validated against three different periods between March 2013 and October 2016. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were used to assess the efficiency of the model in simulating the measured soil moisture. The model exhibited good performance in replicating measured soil moisture during calibration (RMSE = 0.00 m3/m3, MAE = 0.005 m3/m3, and R = 0.70), during validation period 1 (RMSE = 0.035 m3/m3 and MAE = 0.023 m3/m3, and R = 0.72), validation period 2 (RMSE = 0.054 m3/m3 and MAE = 0.039 m3/m3, and R = 0.51), and validation period 3 (RMSE = 0.046 m3/m3 and MAE = 0.032 m3/m3, and R = 0.61), respectively. Remotely sensed precipitation data were used from the CHRS-PERSIANN, CHRS-CCS, and CHRS-PDIR-Now to assess their capabilities in estimating soil moisture. Efficiency evaluation metrics and visual assessment revealed that these products underestimated the soil moisture. The CHRS-CCS outperformed other products in terms of overall efficiency (average RMSE of 0.040 m3/m3, average MAE of 0.023 m3/m3, and an average R of 0.68, respectively). An integrated approach based on numerical modelling and remote sensing employed in this study can help understand the long-term dynamics of soil moisture and soil water balance in the Northern Territory, Australia.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The assimilation of satellite spectral sounder data requires fast and accurate radiative transfer models. This study proposes a novel methodology to automatically parameterize atmospheric optical depths within the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) version 13 scheme using statistical thresholds across pressure levels and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to induce sparsity. Numerical experiments with Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) infrared channels demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy. The sparsity also facilitates the automatic selection of absorbing gases and predictors by channel and pressure level, making it particularly effective for multispectral instruments with numerous atmospheric variables. These findings highlight the potential of sparse regression methods to enhance the efficiency of radiative transfer models for satellite data assimilation.

**摘要**:

The ionospheric E layer (90–150 km altitude) significantly influences ionospheric dynamics and plays a crucial role in radio wave propagation. The Tibetan Plateau, as the “Third Pole,” affects E-layer morphology due to its unique topographical factors. Given the limited systematic studies in this high-altitude region, this study analyzes E-layer spatiotemporal characteristics and their controlling mechanisms over the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. We analyzed foE (critical frequency of E-layer) data from six ionospheric observation stations across the Tibetan Plateau and neighboring areas during 2013–2023, covering a complete solar cycle from solar minimum to maximum. Combined with sunspot numbers as solar activity indicators, we systematically examined diurnal, seasonal, and solar cycle variations to understand regional E-layer behavior patterns. Daytime foE values significantly exceed nighttime values, demonstrating strong solar control. Spatially, Kunming shows the strongest daytime E-layer intensity with peak values reaching 3.12 MHz, while Urumqi exhibits the weakest at 2.94 MHz. Daytime foE values decrease with increasing latitude, whereas nighttime values show opposite latitudinal trends, indicating pronounced diurnal distribution asymmetry. Kunming displays the largest day-night foE variation amplitude, while Urumqi shows the smallest changes. Notably, most stations exhibit E-layer intensity peaks in July rather than June when solar zenith angles are minimum, differing from typical mid-low latitude seasonal behavior. These patterns may be related to complex vertical atmospheric coupling influenced by the region’s unique topography, which could affect the spatiotemporal distribution of the E-layer over the Tibetan Plateau.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The Gain-form of Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LGETKF) has been implemented in the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) with the Model for Prediction Across Scales – Atmosphere (MPAS-A) (i.e., MPAS-JEDI). LGETKF applies vertical localization in model space and is particularly convenient for assimilating satellite radiances that do not have an explicit vertical height assigned to each channel. Additional efforts are made to optimize the ensemble analysis procedure and improve the computational efficiency of MPAS-JEDI's LGETKF. This is the first application of JEDI-based LGETKF for assimilating radiance data in all-weather situations with a global MPAS configuration. The system is first tuned for covariance inflation and horizontal localization settings. It is found that using a combination of relaxation to prior perturbation (RTPP) and relaxation to prior spread (RTPS) outperforms using RTPP or RTPS alone, and using a smaller horizontal localization scale for all-sky radiances is preferable. With the optimized inflation and localization settings, assimilating all-sky radiances of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit – A (AMSU-A) window channels with an 80-member LGETKF improved the forecasts of moisture, wind, clouds, and precipitation fields, when compared to the benchmark experiment without assimilation of all-sky AMSU-A radiances. The positive forecast impact of all-sky AMSU-A radiances is the largest over the tropical regions up to 7 d. Some degradation in the temperature forecasts is seen over certain regions, where the model forecast is likely biased, causing deficiencies for assimilating all-sky data. The LGETKF capability is available in the recent public release of MPAS-JEDI and is ready for research and operational explorations.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The Martian magnetotail current sheet serves as a critical pathway for ionospheric ion escape. Contrary to the conventional view that external magnetic pressure is balanced mainly by internal ion thermal pressure, we present novel observations from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft of an electron‐dominated pressure balance configuration. The current sheet electrons exhibit two distinct populations: a thermal core of ionospheric origin and a suprathermal shell of magnetosheath origin. Their bulk temperature reaches up to three times higher than that outside the current sheet. Based on linear instability analysis, we propose two candidate heating mechanisms: (a) Landau resonant or transit‐time heating by magnetosonic waves likely originating from the magnetosheath, and (b) Landau or cyclotron resonant heating by whistler and electron cyclotron harmonic waves generated spontaneously from the shell‐like electron velocity distribution. These results highlight the potentially significant role of plasma waves in sustaining the Martian atmospheric escape channels.

## 92. Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency: HWBENet for Water Body Extraction in Complex Rural Landscapes

**作者**: Pengyu Lei, Jiang Zhang, Jizheng Yi

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**发表日期**: 2025-11-14

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223711](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223711)

**摘要**:

The accurate and timely extraction of water bodies from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is vital for environmental monitoring, yet segmenting small, scattered, and irregularly shaped water bodies in complex rural landscapes remains a persistent challenge. While state-of-the-art deep learning models have advanced segmentation accuracy, they often achieve this at the cost of substantial computational overhead, limiting their practical application for large-scale monitoring. To address this trade-off between precision and efficiency, this paper introduces HWBENet, a novel hybrid network for water body extraction. HWBENet is built upon a lightweight MobileNetV3 encoder to ensure computational efficiency while preserving strong feature extraction capabilities. Its core innovation lies in two specifically designed modules. First, the Contextual Information Mining Module (CIMM) is proposed to enhance the network’s ability to learn and fuse both global scene-level context and fine-grained local details, which is crucial for identifying fragmented water bodies. Second, an Edge Refinement Module (ERM) is integrated into the decoder, which uniquely leverages transformer mechanisms to sharpen boundary details by effectively fusing prior feature information with up-sampled features. Extensive experiments on challenging rural water body datasets demonstrate that HWBENet strikes a superior balance between accuracy and computational cost. The experimental results validate the finding that HWBENet is an efficient, accurate, and scalable solution, offering significant practical value for large-scale hydrological mapping in complex rural environments.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  
                    Tropical upper‐level cloud (TUC) feedback remains highly uncertain because TUC fraction and its radiative effect respond in complex ways to sea surface temperature (SST) warming. Using a radiative–convective equilibrium (RCE) model, we isolate the radiative impact of TUC changes by adjusting the relative occurrence of clouds and water vapor across the tropics. The resulting TUC feedback parameter, estimated from RCE experiments with observationally constrained versus CMIP6‐derived TUC fractions, is more negative for observational inputs (−1.66 to −1.24 W m

                    <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>
                    ). The stronger negative feedback with observational inputs likely reflects a larger reduction in TUCs with SST warming. In contrast, CMIP6‐based parameters indicate weaker radiative effects of SST‐driven TUC reductions, suggesting that climate models may underestimate this negative feedback.

## 95. Dual-Branch Hyperspectral Open-Set Classification with Reconstruction–Prototype Fusion for Satellite IoT Perception

**作者**: Jialing Tang, Shengwei Lei, Jingqi Liu, Ning Lv, Haibin Qi

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223722](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223722)

**摘要**:

The satellite Internet of Things (SatIoT) enables real-time acquisition and large-scale coverage of hyperspectral imagery, providing essential data support for decision-making in domains such as geological exploration, environmental monitoring, and urban management. Hyperspectral remote sensing classification constitutes a critical component of intelligent applications driven by the SatIoT, yet it faces two major challenges: the massive data volume imposes heavy storage and processing burdens on conventional satellite systems, while dimensionality reduction often compromises classification accuracy; furthermore, mainstream neural network models are constrained by insufficient labeled data and spectral shifts, frequently leading to misclassification of unknown categories and degradation of cross-regional performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an open-set hyperspectral classification method with dual branches of reconstruction and prototype-based classification. Specifically, we build upon an autoencoder. We design a spectral–spatial attention module and an information residual connection module. These modules accurately capture spectral–spatial features. This improves the reconstruction accuracy of known classes. It also adapts to the high-dimensional characteristics of satellite data. Prototype representations of unknown classes are constructed by incorporating classification confidence, enabling effective separation in the feature space and targeted recognition of unknown categories in complex scenarios. By jointly leveraging prototype distance and reconstruction error, the proposed method achieves synergistic improvement in both accurate classification of known classes and reliable detection of unknown ones. Comparative experiments and visualization analyses on three publicly available datasets: Salinas-A, PaviaU, and Dioni-demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms baseline methods such as MDL4OW and IADMRN in terms of unknown detection rate (UDR), open-set overall accuracy (OpenOA), and open-set F1 score, while on the Salinas-A dataset, the performance gap between closed-set and open-set classification is as small as 1.82%, highlighting superior robustness.

## 98. Arbitrary-Scale Planetary Remote Sensing Super-Resolution via Adaptive Frequency–Spatial Neural Operator

**作者**: Hui-Jia Zhao, Xiao-Ping Lu, Kai-Chang Di

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223718](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223718)

**摘要**:

Planetary remote sensing super-resolution aims to enhance the spatial resolution and fine details from low-resolution images. In practice, planetary remote sensing is inherently constrained by sensor payload limitations and communication bandwidth, resulting in restricted spatial resolution and inconsistent scale factors across observations. These constraints make it impractical to acquire uniform high-resolution images, thereby motivating the need for arbitrary-scale super-resolution capable of dynamically adapting to diverse imaging conditions and mission design restrictions. Despite extensive progress in general SR, such constraints remain under-addressed in planetary remote sensing. To address those challenges, this article proposes an arbitrary-scale super-resolution (SR) model, the Adaptive Frequency–Spatial Neural Operator (AFSNO), designed to address the regional context homogeneity and heterogeneous surface features of planetary remote sensing images through frequency separation and non-local receptive field. The AFSNO integrates Frequency–Spatial Hierarchical Encoder (FSHE) and Fusion Neural Operator in a unified framework, achieving arbitrary-scale SR tailored for planetary image characteristics. To evaluate the performance of AFSNO in planetary remote sensing, we introduce Ceres-1K, the planetary remote sensing dataset. Experiments on Ceres-1K demonstrate that AFSNO achieves competitive performance in both objective assessment and perceptual quality while preserving fewer parameters. Beyond pixel metrics, sharper edges and high-frequency detail enable downstream planetary analyses. The lightweight, arbitrary-scale design also suits onboard processing and efficient data management for future missions.

## 100. 3D High-Resolution Seismic Imaging of Elusive Seismogenic Faults: The Pantano-Ripa Rossa Fault, Southern Italy

**作者**: Pier Paolo G. Bruno, Giuseppe Ferrara, Luigi Improta, Stefano Maraio

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**发表日期**: 2025-11-14

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223717](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223717)

**摘要**:

While 3D seismic reflection is well established in hydrocarbon exploration at the kilometer scale in relatively simple offshore settings, its application to shallow faulting in continental basins is rare, owing to difficulties in adapting acquisition and processing to rugged terrains and complex near-surface conditions. We present the first high-resolution 3D seismic study of a seismogenic fault in a structurally complex intramontane basin at depths &lt;200 m. The survey focuses on the Pantano–Ripa Rossa Fault, ruptured during the 1980 Mw 6.9 Irpinia earthquake, the largest Italian event of the past century. This fault cuts across the Pantano di San Gregorio Magno, a small basin filled with Quaternary sediments and showing modest cumulative displacement. Our results demonstrate that in such environments, where morphotectonic analysis and 2D geophysics provide limited constraints, high-resolution 3D seismic imaging is crucial to resolve fault geometry and to assess surface-faulting hazard. The 3D volume reveals a ~35–40 m wide intra-basin deformation zone beneath the 1980 rupture, composed of synthetic and antithetic splays, and highlights lateral variations in fault geometry and stratigraphy. Deformation is distributed and complex, with fault-controlled depocenters, variable sedimentary architectures, and rapid basement-depth changes—features unresolved by 2D data. We infer that the Pantano–Ripa Rossa Fault is relatively young, active since the late Middle Pleistocene, and developed in the hanging wall of the NE-dipping southern basin-bounding fault, challenging previous models that located the master fault along the northern basin margin.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Observations of phytoplankton abundances and community structure are critical towards understanding marine ecosystems. Common approaches to determine group-specific abundances include measuring phytoplankton pigments with high-performance liquid chromatography and DNA-based metabarcoding. Increasingly, mRNA abundances with metatranscriptomics are also employed. As phytoplankton pigments are used to develop and validate remote sensing algorithms, further comparisons between pigments and other metrics are needed to validate the extent to which these measurements agree for group-specific abundances; however, most previous comparisons have been hindered by metabarcoding and metatranscriptomics solely producing relative abundance data. By employing quantitative approaches that express both 18S rRNA genes (DNA) and total mRNA as concentrations, we show that these measurements are related for several eukaryotic phytoplankton groups. We further propose that integration of these can be used to examine ecological patterns more deeply. For example, productivity-diversity relationships of both the whole community and individual groups show a dinoflagellate-driven negative trend rather than the commonly found unimodal pattern. Pigments are also shown to relate to certain harmful algal bloom-forming taxa as well as the expression of sets of genes. Altogether, these results suggest that potential models of pigment concentrations via hyperspectral remote sensing may enable improved assessments of global phytoplankton community structure. These assessments may further support the detection of harmful algal blooms and the development of Earth system models.

## 103. Passive seismic imaging of the Lower Palaeozoic in the Sudret area of Gotland, Sweden

**摘要**:

Abstract. Passive seismic data were acquired together with active seismic data along a 2.8 km long profile in the Sudret area of Gotland, Sweden, as part of a feasibility study for storage of CO2 below the Baltic Sea. Seismic interferometry using cross-correlation and cross-coherence was employed on the passive seismic data. Cross-correlation was used to retrieve virtual shot gathers containing mainly surface waves, while cross-coherence was used to retrieve mainly seismic reflections. Inversion for shear wave velocity and CDP processing of the passive data result in velocity profiles and images that correlate well with borehole data, synthetic seismograms and active seismic data acquired at the site. Interpretations of the passive surface wave and body wave results provide geological information which complement the active data results, the surface waves providing S-wave velocity information and the body waves providing an image that may have better signal quality at deeper levels. Results from the active seismic and passive seismic data correlate well and there is no indication of any large-scale faults in the area. Furthermore, analysis of the frequency and direction of the ambient noise using power spectral density and beam forming show that ocean waves and human activity around the island of Gotland make the Sudret area an ideal location for passive imaging through ambient noise interferometry. Our results illustrate that passive seismic imaging can be an important complement to active seismic data for structural studies of the subsurface with respect to CO2 storage and monitoring in the Gotland area, Sweden, and perhaps elsewhere.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Uranus' magnetosphere presents a unique system to examine global magnetic reconnection processes due to its location far from the Sun. We assess reconnection effectiveness during Voyager 2's Uranus flyby, using a physics‐based analytical model to calculate reconnection voltages applied to the magnetopause. This assessment of reconnection conditions at Uranus uses real‐time varying solar wind conditions as opposed to steady conditions or parameter studies. Here we show that reconnection effectiveness varied considerably over the 2 weeks before Voyager 2 passed into the magnetosphere, with voltages fluctuating between ∼0 and 76 kV; peaking and then sharply dropping off shortly before Voyager 2's entry. Variability in the voltages was found to be strongly influenced by Uranus' extreme magnetic obliquity driving diurnal modulation. Furthermore, changes in solar wind conditions, in particular density and interplanetary magnetic field strength were found to drive additional variations which disrupts the expected ∼17‐hr periodicity of the voltages.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Cloud fraction, crucial to cloud climate effects, remains challenging to predict in general circulation models (GCMs). A neural network‐based scale‐adaptive cloud fraction scheme, predicting cloud area fraction that affects cloud radiative effects, was developed previously using CloudSat observations and demonstrated good performance in capturing cloud spatial distribution and vertical structure. This study further improves the scheme by considering in the inputs the atmospheric stability (affecting cloud formation and evolution) and introducing cloud volume fraction (important for cloud microphysics) as an additional output. Results show that including atmospheric stability significantly enhances both prediction accuracy and scale adaptability for cloud area fraction compared to the original scheme. On the test data set, root‐mean square errors (RMSEs) for liquid, mixed‐phase, and ice clouds are reduced by 15.5%, 11.6%, and 6.67%, respectively. These leads to better predictions of cloud area‐fraction vertical structure and spatial distribution, with RMSE reduced by 33% and 17% in those aspects. Notably, improvements are most pronounced for low‐level clouds, particularly in simulating the seasonal variation of stratocumulus over the Southeast Pacific and the cloud regime transitions along the Pacific Cross‐Section Intercomparison transect of the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Cloud System Study/Working Group on Numerical Experimentation. The new scheme also performs well in predicting cloud volume fraction, showing accuracy and scale adaptability comparable to that for area fraction. Offline evaluations using simulation data from the FGOALS‐f3‐L GCM confirm the superiority of the updated scheme, highlighting its potential to improve cloud fraction representation and associated climate effects in GCMs.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Climate change metrics result from analytical simplification of complex and diverse climate models that are generally not deeply investigated by Life Cycle Assessment communities. We investigated the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to properly gather updated metric equations, climate parameters and associated uncertainties. Metrics are mainly designed with a single gas pulse emission at t0 whereas multi-gas and multi-time pulse emissions are mostly encountered in LCA modelling. Therefore, common static and relative metrics might not suit dynamic climate change assessments (dCCA) that differentiate pulse timing and gas contributions over time. This study focuses on absolute and dynamic metrics – cumulative radiative forcing (AGWP or ΔF) and global temperature change (AGTP or ΔT) – applied to well-mixed greenhouse gases. Cumulative radiative forcing assessment at 20, 100, 500 years appears sufficient. Global temperature change metrics have some advantages that offset their higher uncertainties. (1) Degree Celsius unit better suits peak warming targets. (2) Positive and negative peaks, as well as long-term temperature change, partly alleviate the time horizon decision issue while assessing product systems. (3) Graphical representations are comparable to simultaneously depict short- and long-lived climate forcers. In future assessment reports, IPCC is invited to recall climate equations and updated parameters values in a pedagogical way and to adopt peak and long-term temperature change metrics. dCCA recommendations are to plot ΔF and ΔT temporal profiles of product systems up to 600 years and use suggested metrics. This should enable going towards climate neutrality with more clarity, transparency and understanding.

                    Although metagenomic sequencing has revealed a rich microbial biodiversity in the mammalian gut, methods to genetically alter specific species in the microbiome are highly limited. Here, we introduce Metagenomic Editing (MetaEdit) as a platform technology for microbiome engineering that uses optimized CRISPR-associated transposases delivered by a broadly conjugative vector to directly modify diverse native commensal bacteria from mice and humans with new pathways at single-nucleotide genomic resolution. Using MetaEdit, we achieved in vivo genetic capture of native murine

                    by integrating a metabolic payload that enables tunable growth control in the mammalian gut with dietary inulin. We further show in vivo editing of segmented filamentous bacteria, an immunomodulatory small-intestinal microbial species recalcitrant to cultivation. Collectively, this work provides a paradigm to precisely manipulate individual bacteria in native communities across gigabases of their metagenomic repertoire.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Atoll islands are threatened by multiple climate change impacts, such as sea-level rise, extreme sea-level events, ocean warming, and acidification. A recent approach to assessing climate change risk to these islands is to use multi-criteria expert judgment methods. These approaches can serve as a basis for the development of Bayesian Networks (BNs) integrating expert knowledge and uncertainties to perform climate risk assessments. Here, we use the multi-criteria expert-based assessment of Duvat et al. (2021), who assessed future risk to habitability for four Indian and Pacific Oceans' atoll islands, in order to discuss the advantages and limitations of the BN model. Advantages of the approach include the explicit treatment of uncertainties and the possibility to query expert knowledge in a non-trivial manner. For example, expert knowledge can be used to assess risks to habitability and future uncertainties and to explore inverse problems such as which drivers can exceed specific risk thresholds. Our work suggests that BN, though requiring a certain level of implementation expertise, could be used to assess climate change risk and support climate adaptation.

## 119. Atmospheric and watershed modelling of trifluoroacetic acid from oxidation of HFO-1234ze(E) released by prospective pressurised metered-dose inhaler use in three major river basins

**摘要**:

Abstract. Trans-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene (HFO-1234ze(E); E-CF3CH=CHF) is a hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) with near-zero global warming potential, developed as a propellant for use in pressurised metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs). HFO-1234ze(E) contains a “–CF3” moiety, which makes formation of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) possible in the atmosphere. To quantify the contribution of TFA formed from prospective HFO-1234ze(E)-based pMDIs, we applied a global atmospheric model coupled with detailed watershed modelling. Our atmospheric model incorporates the master chemical mechanism for HFO-1234ze(E) and assumes pMDIs as its sole emission source. Based on global pMDI volume-sales data, we estimate HFO-1234ze(E) emissions at 4.736 Gg yr−1. Although emissions are higher in northern-temperate regions, our model predicts that the highest TFA deposition rates occur in the tropics, likely due to more intensive photolysis of trifluoroacetic aldehyde in temperate zones (favouring non-TFA products) and/or transport of TFA into the tropical zone from nearby regions. Using predicted TFA deposition rates around the Hudson, Cauvery, and Rhine river basins, we applied a fate-and-transport model to estimate TFA concentrations in surface water, soil, and sediments over 30 years. Modelled surface-water TFA levels ranged from 0.8 to 19.3 ng L−1 across the three watersheds, indicating substantial variability between regions. Comparison of Rhine results with the conservative Netherlands drinking-water thresholds (2200 ng L−1) yields a margin of exposure of approximately 700-to-2500-fold. These findings suggest that modelled TFA levels from continuous pMDI-related HFO-1234ze(E) emissions over the study period in the Rhine region are unlikely to pose a risk to human health or the environment.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Mobile bottom-contacting fishing (MBCF) represents a substantial anthropogenic disturbance, significantly disrupting seafloor integrity and altering oceanic carbon storage. In this study, we conducted a benthic trawling experiment on organic-rich muddy sediments in the Mecklenburger Bight, southern Baltic Sea, employing an otter trawl. Multiple trawl tracks were made to assess the temporal impact of bottom fishing on the benthic ecosystem over time scales ranging from days to weeks. Focus was on the wide area where the net footrope was dragged between the otter boards, rather than on much smaller area impacted by the trawl doors. This study constitutes the first comprehensive investigation to systematically monitor the effects of MBCF on benthic oxygen, carbon, alkalinity and nutrient fluxes using autonomous in situ lander measurements. Seafloor observations revealed a profound impact of trawling on seafloor morphology. Flux measurements, coupled with sediment data, indicated reductions in benthic fluxes of O2, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), and nutrients (PO4-3, NH4+, and H4SiO4) within trawled areas compared to control sites. Additionally, observed decreases in organic carbon remineralization rates suggest that MBCF alters benthic respiration by disrupting key biogeochemical processes. Fluxes of O2, DIC, and TA had not returned to baseline levels by the conclusion of the 16 d observation period, indicating prolonged disturbance effects, although natural temporal variations may have an influence. Despite substantial alterations to the benthic biogeochemical pathways, modeling suggests that the reduction in benthic DIC and TA fluxes exerts only a minor influence on CO2 release to the atmosphere compared to the potential impact of pyrite oxidation in resuspended sediment.

**摘要**:

Stress responses enable cells to detect, adapt to, and survive challenges. The benefit of these signaling pathways depends on their reversibility. The integrated stress response (ISR) is elicited by phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2, which traps and inhibits rate-limiting translation factor eIF2B thereby attenuating translation initiation. Termination of this pathway thus requires relieving eIF2B from P-eIF2 inhibition. Here, we found that eIF2 phosphatase subunits PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B (R15B) bound P-eIF2 in complex with eIF2B. Biochemical investigations guided by cryo-EM structures of native eIF2-eIF2B and P-eIF2-eIF2B complexes bound to R15B demonstrated that R15B enabled dephosphorylation of otherwise dephosphorylation-incompetent P-eIF2 on eIF2B. This sheds light on ISR termination, revealing that R15B rescues eIF2B from P-eIF2 inhibition, thereby safeguarding translation and cell fitness.

**摘要**:


                    Mechanical forces are extensively involved in pregnancy and parturition, but their precise roles and mechanisms remain poorly understood. We identified mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 as key mechanotransducers required for labor progression. Genetic deletion of

                    and

                    in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects whereas combined loss markedly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing indicated that loss of PIEZO function reduced expression of connexin43 (

**摘要**:

Abstract. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a crucial role in shaping the global climate system by redistributing heat and influencing large-scale climate patterns. Utilizing the AWI-CM3 model, we investigate the AMOC sensitivity to an abrupt climate change scenario (abrupt-4xCO2) with respect to pre-industrial climate (PI), comparing the AMOC diagnosed in depth (z-AMOC) and density (ρ-AMOC) space. Water mass transformations are assessed to analyze the impact of background climate on surface-forced and interior-mixing-induced transformations. We find that both the location and magnitude of AMOC maximum are directly affected by the framework choice. In PI, the ρ-AMOC maximum is substantially stronger than that of the z-AMOC, while at 26° N the two diagnostics are nearly equivalent. Consequently, the variability of the z-AMOC maximum correlates only with that at 26° N, reflecting isopycnal flattening into constant depth levels in the subpolar North Atlantic inherent to these diagnostics. Strong AMOC weakening is observed under 4xCO2 forcing in both frameworks until simulation year 75. Subsequently, both diagnostics reveal a weaker AMOC with an approximate strength of 7.1 Sv, although with z-AMOC displaying a slight recover towards the end of the simulation and ρ-AMOC oscillating steadily around 5 Sv. At 26° N, variability patterns remain comparable to PI, albeit with an additional ρ-AMOC weakening of approximately 2 Sv, indicating divergence between the representation of AMOC dynamics in the subtropical Atlantic within both frameworks in comparison to PI. The diagnostics in density space allow for the attribution of this further ρ-AMOC weakening to increased entrainment of fresher overflows from amplified GIN seas overturning and reduced deep convection in the Labrador and Irminger Seas. In contrast, the diagnostics in depth space only reveals reduced downwelling around the southwestern Greenland coast and along the path of the Gulf Stream, features that are more challenging to evaluate against available observations. Thus, the comparison between z-AMOC and ρ-AMOC indicates that diagnosing the AMOC in density space provides more physically meaningful information regarding the state of the water mass transformations and their contribution to ocean circulation regimes across the entire Atlantic basin, not only the subpolar North Atlantic, and especially as the climate continues to warm. These findings emphasize the importance of diagnosing AMOC in density space to better understand water mass transformations, which are concealed in depth space and to capture AMOC variability in warmer climates, across all latitudes.

**摘要**:

Abstract. We perform a global inverse modelling analysis to quantify biomass burning emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) from the extreme wildfires in Canada between May and September 2023. Using the GEOS-Chem model, we assimilated observations at 3 d temporal and 2° × 2.5° horizontal resolution from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) separately and then jointly with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) measurements. We also evaluated prior emissions from the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED), Blended Global Biomass Burning Emissions Product eXtended (GBBEPx), Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS), and Canadian Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System (CFFEPS). The assimilation of TROPOMI-only measurements estimated posterior North America emissions for QFED, GBBEPx, GFAS, and CFFEPS of 110.4 ± 20, 112.8 ± 20, 127.2 ± 17, and 125.6 ± 18 Tg CO compared to prior estimates of 37.1, 42.7, 91.0, and 90.2 Tg CO, respectively. The joint assimilation of TROPOMI+TCCON reduced the posterior 1σ uncertainty on the North American emission estimates by up to about 30 %, while showing only a modest impact (&lt;5 %) on the mean estimate of the inferred emissions. An evaluation against independent measurements reveals that adding TCCON data increases the correlations and slightly lowers the biases and standard deviations. Additionally, including an experimental TCCON product at East Trout Lake with higher surface sensitivity, we find better agreement of the assimilation results with nearby in situ tall tower and aircraft measurements. This highlights the potential importance of vertical sensitivity in these experimental data for constraining local surface emissions. Our results demonstrate the complementarity of the greater temporal coverage provided by TCCON with the spatial coverage of TROPOMI when these data are jointly assimilated.

**摘要**:

Branched actin networks formed by the Arp2/3 complex are essential for immune system function. Patients with loss-of-function mutations in the ARPC5 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex develop inflammation and immunodeficiency after birth, leading to early mortality. The basis for these phenotypes remains obscure. We found that loss of ARPC5, but not the ARPC5L isoform, in the mouse hematopoietic system caused early-onset intestinal inflammation after weaning. This condition was initiated by microbiota breaching the ileal mucosa and led to systemic inflammation. ARPC5-deficient macrophages and neutrophils infiltrated the ileum but failed to restrict microbial invasion. Specifically, macrophages that lack ARPC5 struggled to phagocytose and kill intracellular bacteria. Our results highlight the indispensable role of ARPC5-containing, but not ARPC5L-containing, Arp2/3 complexes in mononuclear phagocyte function and host-microbiota homeostasis.

**摘要**:

Very-Low Earth Orbit Synthetic Aperture Radar (VLEO SAR) satellites, defined as SAR satellites operating at orbital altitudes 350 km or below, offer distinct technical advantages compared to conventional SAR satellites. Equipped with a high-resolution SAR payload, the Haishao-1 (HS-1) satellite was successfully launched on 4 December 2024. According to publicly available information, the HS-1 satellite represents the world’s first VLEO SAR satellite and has successfully demonstrated 1-m resolution Stripmap mode imaging with continuous azimuth coverage. Through an analysis of the HS-1 satellite’s system parameters and imaging results, this paper comprehensively explores the advantages of VLEO SAR satellites over traditional orbit SAR satellites, particularly in terms of enhanced resolution, reduced payload costs, and improved constellation deployment capabilities. VLEO SAR satellites possess significant advantages, including the potential for higher-resolution imagery and lower-cost payload designs, positioning them for extensive application prospects in fields such as space-based military reconnaissance, natural resource surveying, and natural disaster monitoring.

## 133. Fully differentiable, fully distributed rainfall-runoff modeling

**摘要**:

Abstract. Traditional hydrological modeling simulates rainfall-runoff process dynamics using process-based models (PBMs). PBMs are grounded in physical laws and therefore highly interpretable. As environmental systems are highly complex, though, subprocesses are sometimes hard or even impossible to identify and quantify. Data-driven approaches, like artificial neural networks (ANNs), offer an alternative. Such approaches can automatically discover hidden relationships within the data. As a result, superior model performance may be achieved. However, the uncovered relationships are hard to analyze within black-box ANNs and often fail to respect physical laws. Differentiable modeling calls for knowledge discovery by combining both approaches, benefiting from their respective advantages. In this work, we present a physically inspired, fully differentiable, and fully distributed model, which we term DRRAiNN (Distributed Rainfall-Runoff ArtIficial Neural Network). DRRAiNN is a neural network model that estimates river discharge at gauging stations based on meteorological forcings and elevation. Focusing on the Neckar river catchment in Southwest Germany, DRRAiNN is trained to predict daily water discharge measurements using data from 17 stations and from ten meteorological years only. DRRAiNN's performance is compared to the performance of the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) reanalysis. Some instances of our model outperform EFAS at lead times of over 50 d in terms of the applied metrics for model performance. As DRRAiNN is fully differentiable and fully distributed, efficient source allocation algorithms can be used to identify the precipitation sources responsible for the water discharge dynamics at specific gauging stations. Besides DRRAiNN's potential to forecast upcoming water discharge dynamics, its full differentiability could be utilized to infer erosion sites from turbidity data, particularly when integrated with an appropriate erosion model.

**DOI**: [10.1126/science.adw9456](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adw9456)

**摘要**:

Determining whether sponges or ctenophores root the animal tree has important implications for understanding early animal evolution. Here, we examined support for these competing hypotheses by constructing large and highly informative data matrices containing sequences from sponges, ctenophores, cnidarians, bilaterians, and diverse animal relatives. The new data matrices and 10 published datasets were analyzed in 785 topology tests conducted using integrative phylogenomics, a method that unifies concatenation and coalescence to identify genes with a consistent phylogenetic signal. All 490 statistically significant tests supported the sponge-sister hypothesis and none supported the ctenophore-sister hypothesis; the remaining 295 tests were inconclusive. These results provide compelling evidence for the sponge-sister hypothesis and suggest that integrative phylogenomics provides a robust and powerful approach for disentangling branches in the tree of life.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Aviation emissions of aerosol particles and aerosol precursor gases alter the Earth's radiation budget via both direct and indirect aerosol effects, resulting in a significant climate effect. Current estimates of aviation-induced climate effects are based on coarse-resolution global aerosol-climate models, which are not able to resolve the microphysical processes at the aircraft plume scale. This results in large uncertainties in the aviation-induced impact on aerosol number and size, which are key quantities for estimating the aerosol indirect effect, especially for low-level liquid-phase clouds. In this work, a double-box aircraft exhaust plume model is developed to explicitly simulate the aerosol microphysics inside a dispersing aircraft exhaust plume, together with a simplified representation of the vortex regime (which begins ∼ 10 s after the aircraft emissions and captures the dynamics of aerosol particle interactions with contrail ice particles). The aircraft exhaust plume model is used to quantify the aviation-induced aerosol number concentration at the end of the dispersion regime (∼46 h) and the results are compared with the result obtained by the instantaneous dispersion approach commonly applied by the global models. The difference between the plume approach (simulated using two boxes) and the instantaneous dispersion approach (simulated by a single box) is defined as the plume correction: for typical cruise conditions over the North Atlantic and typical aviation emission parameters, the plume correction for aviation-induced particle number concentration ranges between −15 % and −4.2 %, depending on the presence or absence of the contrail ice in the vortex regime, respectively. A tendency-based process analysis shows that the negative value of the plume correction is due to the higher efficiency of coagulation and nucleation processes in the plume approach, leading to lower total particle number concentrations compared to the instantaneous dispersion approach. Sensitivity studies over different regions highlight the role of background conditions for the plume microphysics, with the plume correction varying between −12 % for Europe and −42 % for China in a scenario with contrail ice in the vortex regime. Parametric studies performed on various aviation emission parameters used to initialise the plume model demonstrate the high relevance of contrail ice in the vortex regime to considerably reduce the aviation-induced aerosol number concentration in the plume approach. Moreover, the parametric studies show a large sensitivity towards aviation fuel sulfur content, driving sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions and the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) formation, which in turn is a primary driver for the nucleation process. Thanks to its flexible configuration and minor additional computational costs, the plume model presented here can readily be applied in coarse-resolution global aerosol-climate models or used as offline parametrisation to quantify the climate effects of aviation-induced aerosol particles.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Avalanche forecasting is central to managing risk in snow-covered mountain regions. Standards for regional avalanche forecasting were initially developed at national levels. The introduction of the five-level European Avalanche Danger Scale (EADS) in 1993, still in use today, marked a milestone in harmonizing the assessment and communication of avalanche danger. Since then, both forecasting concepts and terminology have evolved. In this study, we present the updated European Avalanche Warning Services (EAWS) Matrix – a consensus-based decision-support tool developed to support consistent and transparent danger level assessments across Europe. The Matrix links three key factors – snowpack stability, its frequency, and avalanche size – to the five danger levels of the EADS. We describe the participatory development process involving avalanche forecasters from across Europe, including expert surveys and operational testing over three winters. The updated Matrix reflects current best practices in regional avalanche forecasting in Europe and complements the Conceptual Model of Avalanche Hazard (CMAH), while avoiding ambiguous likelihood terminology. Its design aligns with the operational forecasting workflow and explicitly addresses inherent uncertainties. We highlight key findings, such as persistent challenges in reliably assessing the factor classes, uncertainty in danger level assignment around certain transition zones, and the need for clearer definitions and better data. Finally, we argue that the Matrix, now adopted as an EAWS standard, provides a robust foundation for future revisions of the European Avalanche Danger Scale.

**摘要**:


                    Antiviral immune systems diversify by integrating new genes into existing pathways, creating new mechanisms of viral resistance. We identified genes encoding a predicted nuclease paired with a trypsin-like protease repeatedly acquired by multiple, otherwise unrelated antiviral immune systems in bacteria. Cell-based and biochemical assays revealed the nuclease is a proenzyme that cleaves DNA only after activation by its partner protease. Two distinct immune systems, Hachiman and AVAST (antiviral adenosine triphosphatase/nucleoside triphosphatase of the STAND superfamily, Avs), use the same mechanism of proteolytic activation despite their independent evolutionary origins. Examination of nuclease-protease inheritance patterns identified caspase-nuclease (

                    ) genomic loci that confer antiviral defense in a pathway reminiscent of eukaryotic caspase activation. These results uncover the coordinated activities of pro-nucleases and their activating proteases within different immune systems and show how coevolution enables defense system innovation.

**摘要**:

Effective feature extraction is a key issue in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification task. Recent works have studied hyperspectral classification models based on various deep architectures. However, the specific architecture cannot fully exploit the complementary diversity of global and local features in HSIs, resulting in suboptimal results. To address these issues, we fully utilize the advantages of GNN and CNN in global and local feature extraction and design a new end-to-end global–local feature fusion enhancement network (GLFFEN). Specifically, we first construct a GNN with dynamically weighted neighbor contributions using superpixel-segmented patches as nodes, named the Graph Attention (GA) branch. Additionally, we design a spatial–spectral feature attention module (SSFAM) to enhance the ability of the CNN to extract spatial and spectral features in local neighborhoods, termed the spatial–spectral feature attention (SSFA) branch. Moreover, a multi-feature adaptive fusion (MAF) module is proposed to solve the problem of weight distribution during global–local feature fusion. Experiments on three well-known HSI datasets have shown that our GLFFEN surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three widely used metrics.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Deep learning hydrologic models have made their way from research to applications. More and more national hydrometeorological agencies, hydro power operators, and engineering consulting companies are building Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for operational use cases. All of these efforts come across similar sets of challenges – challenges that are different from those in controlled scientific studies. In this paper, we tackle one of these issues: how to deal with missing input data? Operational systems depend on the real-time availability of various data products – most notably, meteorological forcings. The more external dependencies a model has, however, the more likely it is to experience an outage in one of them. We introduce and compare three different solutions that can generate predictions even when some of the meteorological input data do not arrive in time, or not arrive at all: First, input replacing, which imputes missing values with a fixed number; second, masked mean, which averages embeddings of the forcings that are available at a given time step; third, attention, a generalization of the masked mean mechanism that dynamically weights the embeddings. We compare the approaches in different missing data scenarios and find that, by a small margin, the masked mean approach tends to perform best.

**摘要**:


                    DNA methylation loss at transposable elements (TEs) can affect neighboring genes and be epigenetically inherited in plants, yet the determinants and importance of this additional system of inheritance are unknown. In this work, we demonstrate in
                    <jats:italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic>
                    that transgenerational stability of experimentally induced hypomethylation at TE loci is constrained by small RNAs derived from related copies. Using data from more than 700 strains collected worldwide, we uncover similar and recurrent hypomethylation at hundreds of these TE loci, often near genes. Most natural epivariants that we tested can be inherited without DNA sequence changes and are therefore bona fide epialleles, although genetic factors modulate their recurrence or persistence. Epiallelic variants often cause gene expression changes and may be targets of selection, revealing their contribution to heritable phenotypic variation in nature.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Subglacial bedrock properties are key to understanding and predicting the dynamics and future evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. However, the ice sheet bed is largely inaccessible for direct sampling, and characterization of subglacial properties has so far relied on expert interpretation of airborne geophysical data. To reduce subjective choices in the joint analysis of data and related biases, we present a Self-Organizing Map (SOM), an unsupervised machine learning technique. The concept of SOMs is briefly introduced and we discuss data selection and their associated attributes. First, we analyzed the correlation between attributes to provide a validation of an appropriate choice. Next, we trained the SOM on attributes derived from gravity, magnetics and ice-penetrating radar data for the Wilkes and Aurora Subglacial Basin region in East Antarctica. In contrast to earlier studies, our approach uses original line data as much as possible. These have a much higher resolution than the smooth gridded products used in previous studies. Our results show marked agreement with past studies on predicting regional bed characteristics such as the presence of crystalline basement and sedimentary basins. Additionally, our results indicate the ability to resolve finer details, demonstrating the potential in applying SOM to subglacial geologic mapping.

**摘要**:


                    α-Tropolones comprise an unsaturated seven-membered ring bearing a hydroxyl substituent adjacent to a polarized carbon–oxygen π-bond. This polarization imparts a permanent molecular dipole and aromatic stabilization to the ring, resulting in unique physical properties, including affinity for divalent metals and ambiphilic reactivity. Among secondary metabolites that contain α-tropolones, the pseudodimeric isolate (–)-gukulenin A (

                    ) stands out for its complexity and has shown promise in treating murine models of ovarian cancer. Here we describe an enantioselective synthesis of (–)-gukulenin A (
                    <jats:bold>7</jats:bold>
                    ). Key steps include a directed C–H arylation, a tandem Grob fragmentation–alkylation, an innovative synthesis of methyl tropolone ethers, a multicomponent cross-coupling, and a thermal carbonyl–ene reaction. Structure–function studies establish the dimeric tropolone and aldehyde substructures as drivers of cytotoxicity.

## 150. Modeling on the drought stress impact on the summertime biogenic isoprene emissions in South Korea

**摘要**:

Abstract. Biogenic isoprene emissions play an important role in air quality so it is important to quantify their response to extreme events such as drought. This study aims at constraining drought stress on biogenic isoprene emissions in South Korea using satellite formaldehyde (HCHO) column, the key product of isoprene oxidation, and a chemistry transport model (GEOS-Chem) with Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1 (MEGAN2.1). It was found that the HCHO column from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) increased by 5.4 % under the drought condition compared to the normal condition, but GEOS-Chem simulated a 20.23 % increase indicating an overestimation of isoprene emissions under drought. We implemented two existing drought stress algorithms in MEGAN2.1 and found they were not effective to reduce HCHO column biases in South Korea because those algorithms were proposed and developed for the Southeast United States (SE US). To improve this, we applied an iterative finite difference mass balance (IFDMB) method to estimate isoprene emissions using the OMI HCHO column. With this method, isoprene emissions were reduced by 60 % under the drought condition compared to those simulated by the standard MEGAN2.1 implemented in GEOS-Chem. The increase of HCHO column under the drought condition compared to the normal condition was also reduced to 10.71 %, which is comparable to that in the satellite retrievals. Based on isoprene emission difference between MEGAN2.1 and IFDMB, we developed the empirical equations to adjust isoprene emissions in South Korea that also improved model prediction of the secondary pollutant such as ozone.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Inland waters play an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle by burying carbon in aquatic sediments while simultaneously releasing CO2 to the atmosphere and laterally exporting carbon along the land-ocean aquatic continuum. Especially in hardwater lakes, the close connection between primary production and calcite precipitation results in a poorly understood balance of carbon burial and release, with stronger coupling of organic and inorganic processes than in softwater lakes. To better understand these dynamics, we analyzed organic and inorganic carbon fluxes in a yearlong (June 2022 to June 2023) sediment trap study in Lake Geneva, the largest natural lake in Western Europe. Two sediment traps – one deployed in the subaqueous delta of the upper Rhône River, the other in the lake's deepest basin – were sampled monthly. Analyzing radiocarbon (14C) signatures of particulate organic and inorganic carbon allowed us to resolve allochthonous (external) and autochthonous (internal) contributions to absolute carbon fluxes. We found that the flux of autochthonous particulate inorganic carbon in the river-proximal deltaic site was approximately four times higher than in the distal one. This is likely the result of calcite precipitation driven by increased fluvial supply of nutrients and suspended carbonate-bearing particles. Sediment core analysis in the same location suggests efficient preservation of this calcite over centennial timescales, which we conservatively estimate around 7–10 Gg C yr−1 lake-wide. This indicates at least partial offset of the CO2 released during calcite precipitation and is an important flux to be considered in mechanistic carbon cycle models.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  During the T119 bistatic radar (BSR) experiment, the Cassini spacecraft observed a collection of lakes in Titan's Northern Lake District. Specular reflections from liquid surfaces were clearly detected at X‐band ground‐based station DSS‐43 (Canberra), spaced out by sudden drops of power in correspondence to solid terrains. The forward scattering radar cross section suggests that all the observed lakes share similar composition and surface roughness. From the analysis of the reflected signals, all the lakes appear to be methane‐dominated and potentially rippled by a few millimeters of aggregate surface roughness. A subsequent observation of the same district by Cassini RADAR in altimetry mode during T126 intersected the bistatic track over one of these lakes, revealing uniform backscattering across several basins. Lakes observed in bistatic configuration exhibit similar characteristics to those observed in altimetry mode, suggesting that all the liquid bodies present at Titan's lake district may have similar composition and roughness.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Sand‐bedded rivers self‐organize into bedforms regulating flow resistance and sediment transport. Emerging research focuses on characterizing multiscale bedform configurations, but their stability remains unknown. Here, we analyzed twelve flume experiments of varying sizes to uncover a sharp transition between two independent multiscale bedform configurations. Bedform groups—quasi‐stable collections of bedforms—that have similar heights and celerities as constituent bedforms are found in flows with suspension number (ratio of shear velocity to sediment settling velocity; ) less than 1. In contrast, large dunes with smaller, faster‐moving superimposed bedforms characterize flows with  &gt; 1. The transition between these two states abruptly occurs at  in low Froude‐number flows, and is further supported by distinct autogenic noise characteristics in bed evolution. Our work provides novel insight into factors controlling multiscale bedform configurations, and highlights the critical influence of suspension number on river morphology.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Understanding creep is essential for assessing seismic hazards along the creeping Hayward Fault, which threatens the San Francisco area. Current 1‐D monitoring methods, like creepmeters and theodolites, provide limited measurements with low spatial resolution. InSAR offers higher 2‐D spatial sampling but lower temporal resolution. We introduce a novel method using coda wave interferometry (CWI) to monitor creep in 2‐D with high resolution. By calculating changes in ambient seismic noise travel times, we relate these measurements to creep offsets, bridging the gap between existing methods. Applied to seismic data from 2021 around the Hayward Fault, our CWI‐derived offsets aligned with creepmeter measurements, revealing continuous and episodic creep. A 2‐D regionalization identified a spatial boundary between these regimes, corroborating previous findings. This approach could enhance seismic monitoring and improve understanding of fault mechanics and earthquake risks.

## 158. Different repair pathways support intact or truncated insertions by R2 retrotransposon protein

**作者**: Jeremy J. R. McIntyre, Connor A. Horton, Kathleen Collins

**期刊**: Science

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**DOI**: [10.1126/science.adz3121](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adz3121)

**摘要**:

Non-LTR retrotransposon proteins copy their RNA template into a genome via coordinated nicking and reverse transcriptase activities of target-primed reverse transcription. Mechanisms by which the first-strand cDNA becomes stably inserted duplex, including requirements for junction formation at the cDNA 3′ end and second-strand synthesis, are unknown. We screened for cellular factors that influence site-specific transgene synthesis into the human genome by an R2 retrotransposon protein. We discover that insertion lengths and junction signatures differ based on alternative repair processes involving ATR-dependent Polymerase θ end-joining, 53BP1-directed Shieldin/CST-Polα-primase fill-in synthesis, or limited strand annealing dependent on CtIP-MRN. These insights shed light on how genome-primed cDNA synthesis by a non-LTR retrotransposon protein can support stable new gene insertion, with major implications for native retrotransposon mobility and genome engineering.

**摘要**:

At the United Nations General Assembly in September, President Xi of China delivered a noteworthy update in what has been a dismal year for climate news: China would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 7 to 10% from its peak levels by 2035. For many, this was welcome news. But others deemed China’s pledge insufficiently “ambitious.” Yet the conceptual and political basis for climate ambition is unclear. This matters in a year when countries will submit updated emissions pledges under the Paris Agreement.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Quantifying real-world emission reductions is a core goal of atmospheric inversion methods, yet direct validation against known events remains rare, especially for reactive species like ammonia. In this study, we have applied local-scale Bayesian inversions using ground-based measurements and the LOTOS-EUROS air quality model, with high-resolution emission inventories as prior input, not to explore a theoretical scenario, but to evaluate a documented emission reduction. On the island of Schiermonnikoog in the Netherlands, where GVE (grazing livestock units) decreased from 639 to 541, with a particularly notable reduction in dairy cattle, ammonia emissions are expected a 23 % reduction between 2019 and 2022. Our inversion captured a similar trend, estimating a 51 % decrease, which may be overestimated, largely attributed to uncertainties in the 2019 posterior emissions. The posterior for 2022 shows consistency with the validation and indicates a 27 % reduction compared with the prior emissions of 2019. The associated uncertainty, derived from the posterior error covariance, highlights both the potential of the method and its limitations for policy verification. Moreover, we developed a method to assess the usefulness of individual observations and propose that adding a single high-quality continuous measurement in a strategically chosen location can significantly enhance the inversion performance. This strengthens the observational constraint and enhances the system’s ability to resolve temporal variations in emissions.

**摘要**:

Dogs exhibit an exceptional range of morphological diversity as a result of their long-term association with humans. Attempts to identify when dog morphological variation began to expand have been constrained by the limited number of Pleistocene specimens, the fragmentary nature of remains, and difficulties in distinguishing early dogs from wolves on the basis of skeletal morphology. In this study, we used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyze the size and shape of 643 canid crania spanning the past 50,000 years. Our analyses show that a distinctive dog morphology first appeared at about 11,000 calibrated years before present, and substantial phenotypic diversity already existed in early Holocene dogs. Thus, this variation emerged many millennia before the intense human-mediated selection shaping modern dog breeds beginning in the 19th century.

## 165. Imprints of sea ice, wind patterns, and atmospheric systems on summer water isotope signatures at Hercules Névé, East Antarctica

**摘要**:

Abstract. This study investigated the influence of summer climate variability on water isotopes (δ18O, δ2H, and deuterium excess[dexc]) in a Hercules Névé ice core from Antarctica. High-resolution ERA5 reanalysis data for the austral summer (DJF, 1979–2015) were used to assess the relative contributions of temperature, precipitation, wind patterns (v- and u-winds), ocean condition (sea ice concentration [SIC] and sea surface temperature [SST]), and large-scale circulation system (Amundsen Sea Low [ASL] and Zonal Wave-3 [ZW3]) to isotopic variability. The results show that higher temperatures and precipitation coincide with isotopically enriched δ18O, confirming their combined role in controlling isotopic enrichment. Wind patterns also contribute meaningfully but in a more complex way: enhanced southerly winds (positive v-wind anomalies) tend to increase δ18O by transporting relatively warm, moisture-rich air from lower latitudes, whereas stronger westerly winds (positive u-wind anomalies) are associated with more depleted isotopic values, likely reflecting colder or more distant moisture sources. Additionally, the dexc exhibits a positive correlation with SIC and negative correlations with SST, providing valuable insights into moisture source processes in the study region during austral summer. Variations in the ASL and ZW3 further modulate heat and moisture transport, reinforcing their role as key atmospheric drivers of isotopic variability. Taken together, these findings suggest that the summer isotope record at Hercules Névé reflects not only local temperature changes but also the broader imprint of ocean–atmosphere interactions, including sea-ice variability and large-scale circulation patterns. This study highlights the potential of coastal Antarctic ice cores to provide improved constraints on coupled climate processes and to refine paleoclimate reconstructions for the Ross Sea region.

## 166. Atmospheric sounding of the boundary layer over alpine glaciers using fixed-wing UAVs

**DOI**: [10.5194/amt-18-6493-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-18-6493-2025)

**摘要**:

Abstract. Glaciers are an integral part of the high mountain environment and interact with the overlying atmosphere and surrounding terrain in a complex and dynamic manner. The energy exchange between the glacier surface and the overlying atmosphere controls ice melt rates and promotes a characteristic microclimate, including the formation of a low-level katabatic jet that interacts with other, often thermally driven winds in alpine terrain. Information on the local circulation and structure of the atmospheric boundary layer over glaciers is crucial for studying cryosphere-atmosphere interactions and for investigating the characteristics of the katabatic wind, its broader cooling effect, and its susceptibility to be disrupted by strong valley or synoptic winds that promote heat advection from the ice- and snow-free periphery towards the glacier. While the number of ground-based measurements from weather stations and meteorological towers installed on glaciers for boundary layer research has increased in recent years, a lightweight and mobile measurement technique for atmospheric sounding over alpine glaciers has not yet been available. Here we describe a new measurement technique based on a low-cost and open-source fixed-wing UAV, which allows sounding the atmospheric boundary layer over glaciers up to several hundred metres above the surface. In the frame of a feasibility study in 2021, two half-day (16 June, 23 September) and two 24 h campaigns (9/10 July, 25/26 August), including nocturnal soundings, were performed, demonstrating the UAV's capability to reach heights of up to 800 m above the glacier surface. From these campaigns, 40 profiles of air temperature, specific humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and turbulence were derived. The results highlight characteristic features of the glacier boundary layer, including a persistent surface-based inversion, a cool and dry katabatic wind confined to the lowest 50 m a.g.l., an overlying shear layer, and a warmer, often more humid valley wind above 100–200 m a.g.l. These observations illustrate how the boundary layer responds to synoptic forcing and local winds and demonstrate the potential of UAV-based atmospheric soundings for advancing glacier meteorology in complex alpine terrain.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  We ask whether cloud turbulence differs from typical fluid turbulence, and answer in the affirmative: small‐scale turbulence is significantly enhanced in clouds by inertial droplets. This enhancement stems from a mismatch in time scales between vortex evacuation and condensation. Inertial droplets are centrifuged out of vortical regions much faster than condensation can occur. They then grow by condensation, releasing latent heat locally. Our simulations reveal that vortical regions co‐locate with cooler temperatures and higher moisture, leading to sharp density gradients at their boundaries. These gradients drive baroclinic torque, generating small‐scale turbulence. The time scales involved align with our scaling estimates. While our earlier two‐dimensional model anticipated this effect, it underestimated its intensity and limited it to sub‐Kolmogorov scales. The enhancement of turbulence over inertial scales that we find here could drive rapid raindrop growth.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Lidar is an effective tool to measure snow depth over key watersheds across the United States. Lidar-derived snow depth observations from airborne platforms have demonstrated centimeter-level accuracy at high spatial resolution. However, ground-based and airborne lidar surveys are costly and limited in space and time. In recent years, there has been an emerging interest in using spaceborne lidar to estimate snow depth. Preliminary results from spaceborne lidar altimeters such as the NASA Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) can provide routine snow depth retrievals over watersheds, though further research on accuracy, coverage, and operational potential is needed. In this review, we outline the current status of research using spaceborne lidar to derive snow depth. We focus on the currently operational ICESat-2 mission, with a summary of snow observations gathered from previous studies. An example snow depth retrieval using ICESat-2 is also given over the Alaskan tundra. We also outline best practices for spaceborne lidar snow depth retrieval, based on findings from recent studies. We conclude with a discussion of ongoing challenges for spaceborne lidar, with suggestions for future studies and requirements for future mission concepts.

**摘要**:

The use of digital photogrammetry and laser data acquisition systems, along with the ability to mount these sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has revolutionized rockfall assessment. While these techniques have facilitated numerous studies across diverse scenarios, complex environments like narrow gorges necessitate the integration of various geomatic techniques to achieve complete and accurate spatial products. To address the critical gap in the literature regarding standardized multi-sensor integration in narrow gorges, this study presents a novel methodology for the cohesive integration of data from these techniques, leveraging their respective strengths to generate reliable products for rockfalls risk assessment. To validate the methodology, we applied this approach to a challenging rockfall susceptibility study at the Caminito del Rey in Málaga, Spain. The site presented significant complexities, including vertical walls hundreds of meters high with abundant overhangs, and canyons as narrow as 10 m, severely limiting single-technique approaches. The successful integration of these diverse datasets yielded a comprehensive, very high-resolution point cloud (1–10 cm density), among other products, covering the entire study area, making it ideal for detailed rockfall assessment and simulation. The approach has demonstrated that data fusion from multiple techniques supposes an advantage because one supports the other both in data coverage and in processing. Although processing the extensive acquired information presented a significant challenge, a successful balance between data volume and processing capacity was achieved, ensuring the outputs met the specific requirements for these studies.

                  In collisionless plasma environments, wave‐particle interactions facilitate efficient energy exchange between particles and phase‐coherent waves. Using Magnetospheric Multiscale mission observations, we report a novel two‐layers bridge‐like arcs structure in ion energy spectrum, formed by simultaneous nonlinear interactions between large‐amplitude electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves and ions ( and ). Even after incorporating finite wave‐field effects into the resonance condition, only a few instances exist where the minimum correction energy is lower than the observed value, thus confirming the presence of an anomalous heating mechanism. The lower‐layer bridge‐like arcs are formed by the interaction between  and EMIC waves, while the upper‐layer bridge‐like arcs result from the nonlinear interaction between  ions and EMIC waves. These observations present the first direct evidence of continuous energy exchange between ions and EMIC waves, providing a new perspective for studying the simultaneous nonlinear interactions between ions and EMIC waves.

                    . However, previous observations have shown much lower abundances of this molecule than predicted with atmospheric chemistry models. We report JWST spectroscopic observations of phosphine in the atmosphere of the brown dwarf Wolf 1130C. Multiple absorption lines due to phosphine have been detected around 4.3 micrometers, from which we calculated a phosphine abundance of 0.100 ± 0.009 parts per million. This abundance is consistent with disequilibrium atmospheric chemistry models that reproduced the phosphine abundances in Jupiter and Saturn and is much higher than abundances previously reported for other brown dwarfs or exoplanets. This difference may be related to the low abundance of elements heavier than helium in Wolf 1130C.

## 176. Exploiting Diffusion Priors for Generalizable Few-Shot Satellite Image Semantic Segmentation

**作者**: Fan Li, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Xuan Wang, Xuanbin Wang, Yuelei Xu

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223706](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223706)

**摘要**:

Satellite segmentation is vital for spacecraft perception, supporting tasks like structural analysis, fault detection, and in-orbit servicing. However, the generalization of existing methods is severely limited by the scarcity of target satellite data and substantial morphological differences between target satellites and training samples, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for few-shot satellite segmentation, named DiffSatSeg, which leverages the powerful compositional generalization capability of diffusion models to address the challenges inherent in satellite segmentation tasks. Specifically, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that fully exploits the strong prior knowledge of diffusion models while effectively accommodating the unique structural characteristics of satellites as rare targets. We further propose a segmentation mechanism based on distributional similarity, designed to overcome the limited generalization capability of conventional segmentation models when encountering novel satellite targets with substantial inter-class variations. Finally, we design a consistency learning strategy to suppress redundant texture details in diffusion features, thereby mitigating their interference in segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding a remarkable 33.6% improvement over existing approaches even when only a single target satellite image is available. Notably, our framework also enables reference-based segmentation, which holds great potential for practical deployment and real-world applications.

## 178. ENSO Influence on Subsequent Early‐Summer North American Atmospheric Circulation: Role of Land‐Atmosphere Interaction

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Air‐sea interaction is widely recognized as a key pathway through which El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events exert delayed impacts. This study highlights an additional role of land‐atmosphere interactions in modulating North American atmospheric circulation during ENSO‐post early summer. Using reanalysis data and numerical simulations, we identify an ocean‐land‐atmosphere relay mechanism. El Niño‐induced persistent upstream sea surface temperature anomalies enhance moisture transport into North America, which triggers a dipole pattern of land temperature anomalies—cooling in the midlatitudes and warming at higher latitudes—through surface turbulent latent heat flux and shortwave radiation. These land surface anomalies feedback on the atmosphere via modifications in sensible heat flux and longwave radiation, weakening low‐level meridional air temperature gradient and atmospheric baroclinicity. The resulting negative transient eddy vorticity forcing induces an equivalent barotropic geopotential high anomaly and weakens the westerly jet around 50°N. These findings underscore the essential role of land‐atmosphere coupling in extending ENSO's summer influence.

## 179. Sulfate-dominant apatite in the deep arc crust indicates that high oxidation state promotes copper fluxing in arcs

**DOI**: [10.1130/g53549.1](https://doi.org/10.1130/g53549.1)

**摘要**:

Sulfide saturation during arc magma evolution depletes ascending magmas in chalcophile elements (e.g., Cu) and promotes metal recycling into the mantle. Although sulfide saturation is posited to be delayed by high oxygen fugacity (ƒO2) in the deep crust of arcs, the timing and controls on sulfide saturation in arcs remain disputed. Here, we report new constraints on S speciation in the deep crust of arcs using measurements of the relative abundance of S species (S2−, S4+, and S6+) in apatite in deep crustal arc cumulates from the Sierra Valle Fértil−La Huerta (Argentina). Sulfide is rare in primitive cumulates (&amp;lt;0.01%), only becoming abundant in evolved cumulates (Mg# &amp;lt;0.65), indicating that sulfide saturation was delayed in the magmatic evolution. Apatite yields consistently high S6+/ΣS (0.8−1.0), giving an fO2 of 1.4 ± 0.4 log units above the fayalite-magnetite-quartz (FMQ) redox buffer. Delayed sulfide saturation was therefore the result of the parental magma having elevated fO2 acquired from its mantle source. We use modeling to show that magma differentiation at FMQ+1.4 would be sufficient to delay sulfide saturation and produce mafic to intermediate melts with elevated Cu concentrations. Oxidized, hydrous intermediate magmas may therefore play a key role in delivering elevated sulfur and Cu fluxes to magmatic-hydrothermal systems and the atmosphere, contributing to the Cu deficit of modern continental crust.

## 180. Global Simulations Suggest Biomass Burning Aerosol Emissions From Grassland Fires Could Be Important Ice Nucleating Particles

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Ice nucleating particles (INP) capable of nucleating ice crystals via immersion freezing at temperatures above approximately −35°C may strongly influence cloud glaciation, with implications for global precipitation and climate feedback. In addition to mineral dust, soil dust, and marine organics, laboratory and field measurements suggest biomass burning aerosols (BBA) can act as immersion‐mode INP between around −30°C and −15°C. However, the contribution of BBA to the global INP budget remains poorly understood due to poor knowledge of which fuels yield INPs, uncertainties in global coverage of those fuels, and unknown size distributions of the INPs in the BBA. Nonetheless, with some understanding of these uncertainties from sensitivity studies, the relative importance of ice nucleation activity of BBA compared to other INP sources can be quantified. In this work, we investigate the potential global importance of BBA as INP using a global aerosol‐climate model, specifically the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM). We evaluate the model using field campaign data sets. We examine potential uncertainties in fuel types and particle sizes on BBA‐based INP concentrations. Averaged over June–September between 15°S and 50°S, BBA is a more important INP than dust and marine INP about 30% of the time at altitudes with temperatures between −30°C and −20°C. Our simulations therefore suggest BBA INPs may be at least as important as mineral dust and marine INP over the atmospheric regions and seasons where grassland fires are frequent.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Climate warming is intensifying seasonal water cycle patterns, with significant consequences for societies and ecosystems. However, the changes in seasonal precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P–E) over recent decades, and the factors contributing to these changes, remain poorly understood—despite a documented decline in annual water availability (annual P–E). In this study, we used multiple observational datasets to quantify global seasonal P–E shifts from 2000 to 2020. Our findings reveal a significant increasing trend (0.15 mm/month/yr, p &lt; 0.01) in seasonal range in P–E, primarily driven by a significant global decrease in minimum P–E values, which affected more than 64% land areas. This decline was particularly pronounced in both hemispheres, while contrasting trends in maximum P–E between the hemispheres masked any clear global trend. The reduction in minimum P–E was largely attributed to increased evapotranspiration (76%), highlighting its critical role in amplifying seasonal P–E. Climate models are generally able to capture the seasonal variations of P–E, especially at longer time scales, despite existing spatial disparities. Therefore, using suitable climate models to project future P–E seasonality can provide usable information for future adaptation in a warming world. This study underscores the growing imbalance in global seasonal water availability with climate warming.

**DOI**: [10.1126/science.adx7390](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adx7390)

**摘要**:

Tetrapods invaded oceanic environments after the cataclysmic end-Permian mass extinction (EPME), with temnospondyl amphibian to reptile-dominated assemblages succeeding across the Early Triassic [~251.9 to 247.2 million years ago (Ma)]. However, conflicting fossil occurrences, divergence estimates, and stratigraphic time averaging make the tempo of this landmark evolutionary transition uncertain. In this work, we describe an oceanic tetrapod ecosystem from a condensed mid–Early Triassic (early Spathian, ~249 Ma) bone bed on the arctic island of Spitsbergen. Apex predator ichthyosaurians, small-bodied ichthyopterygians, durophagous ichthyosauriforms, semiaquatic archosauromorphs, euryhaline temnospondyls, coelacanths, lungfish, ray-finned fish, and sharks formed an unexpectedly complex trophic network. Comparative diversity analyses further show that heterogeneous marine vertebrate communities were well established by the late-earliest Triassic (Dienerian-Smithian, ~251 Ma) and integrated fully variegate tetrapod niches by ~3 million years after the EPME.

## 185. Electrolytes that reduce electro-osmotic drag improve fast charging of lithium-ion batteries

**DOI**: [10.1126/science.adv1739](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adv1739)

**摘要**:

Fast charging (at rates greater than 4 C) is essential for high-energy lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles yet remains challenging owing to a lack of understanding of fast-charging barriers. Conventional optimization strategies concentrate on shortening lithium-ion transport pathways through electrode structure modification, which often compromises energy densities. In this work, we demonstrate that thick-electrode fast charging is constrained by solvent withdrawal within porous electrodes and the resulting electro-osmotic drag polarization, which is driven by cation-induced electro-osmotic drag. To reduce electro-osmotic drag polarization, we designed electrolytes with weak cation solvation and strong anion solvation, where a difluorinated solvent weakens lithium-cation solvation and its difluoromethyl hydrogen atoms enhance anion solvation through hydrogen bonding. This electrolyte enables thick-electrode, energy-dense batteries to achieve 80% charge within 13 minutes.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The boron isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera is a powerful tool to reconstruct ocean pH and CO2 in the past. Applications to the high-latitude and polar oceans are however limited as robust calibrations between the δ11B of foraminifera and ocean pH in these regions are lacking. Here, we present a new empirical calibration for the high latitude Arctic species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma and the sub-polar to temperate species Neogloboquadrina incompta using towed specimens from the Labrador Sea, Baffin Bay, and the Nordic Seas. When paired with in situ hydrographic data, this approach allows us to avoid key assumptions used in traditional core top calibrations that are required to link shell geochemical composition to hydrographic conditions during their formation. We show that the foraminifera δ11B of the species analysed is well correlated with the δ11B of seawater borate ion. Further, the foraminiferal δ11B values are consistently lower than seawater equilibrium borate values, consistent with the interpretation of more acidic seawater in the microenvironment due to respiration. However, unlike published calibrations for non-spinose species to date the slope of the δ11B foraminifera to δ11B borate calibration is &gt;1. We discuss several drivers of this higher sensitivity to pH and describe the possible role of vital effects in determining the boron isotopic composition of N. pachyderma and N. incompta. Finally, we apply the tow calibration to core top samples from the Nordic Seas to validate the calibration for use in the paleorecord.

**摘要**:

The transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offers a potential treatment for heart failure, but arrhythmogenic automaticity can arise from these transplanted cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of RADA16, a clinically approved self-assembling peptide that forms nanofibers after injection, on the vascularization, myofibril structure, and electrophysiological adaptation of hiPSC-CMs transplanted into rat hearts. RADA16 accelerated the transition of hiPSC-CMs toward adultlike gene expression profiles, enhanced sarcomere organization, and improved vascularization in the transplanted site. Flexible mesh nanoelectronics revealed fibrillation of transplanted hiPSC-CMs within the beating recipient heart, and RADA16 drastically reduced the automaticity of hiPSC-CMs. Our findings demonstrate the potential of self-assembling nanofibers to advance cardiac cell therapy and how flexible mesh nanoelectronics technology could improve safety.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) constituents, such as the 2-methyltetrols (2-MT) and 2-methyltetrol sulfates (2-MTS), have been readily detected in atmospheric aerosols (PM2.5) and within mixtures containing ammonium sulfate (AS). Despite its prevalence, the water uptake of 2-MT, 2-MTS, and their mixtures is not well understood. In this study, we determine the physicochemical properties (e.g., surface activity, diffusivity, phase morphology) of synthesized 2-MT and 2-MTS samples and their mixtures with AS. 2-MT and 2-MTS have been identified as surface active and viscous. Thus, dynamic surface tension (σs/a) measurements were taken to determine organic diffusion coefficients (Ds). The droplet growth of organic / AS mixtures was measured under subsaturated conditions using a humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer (H-TDMA) at 88.2 % RH ±1.5 %. Droplet activation was measured under supersaturated (&gt;100 % RH) conditions using a cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNC); supersaturation (SS) ranged from 0.3 %–1.4 %. Hygroscopicity in both regimes was parameterized by the single hygroscopicity parameter κ. This study demonstrates how diffusion and salting-in effects influence the water uptake of synthesized, isoprene-derived SOA mixtures. Results show that when mixed with AS, organic diffusion for 2-MTS / AS becomes an order of magnitude faster, while 2-MT diffusivity remains unchanged. Both 2-MT / AS and 2-MTS aerosols present a plateau in subsaturated κ values close to pure AS. However, under supersaturated conditions, 2-MTS / AS behaves ideally and well mixed and can be characterized by κ-Köhler theory. Isoprene-derived SOAs like 2-MT and 2-MTS samples are ubiquitous, and thus, the impact from biogenic sources and its non-ideal thermodynamic properties must be considered in aerosol–cloud interactions.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Understanding the urban-rural patterns and driving drivers behind the recent decrease in particulate matter (PM) pollution across eastern China is essential for assessing the efficacy of environmental policies and ensuring equitable health co-benefits. By employing an interpretable, end-to-end machine learning framework integrating satellite observations, meteorological factors, and auxiliary datasets, this study reveals changes in urban and rural PM pollution and the underlying drivers. During the period 2015–2023, the average decrease rates of PM10 and PM2.5 in eastern China were −4.02 ± 1.29 and −2.41 ± 0.91 µg m−3 yr−1, respectively. The rate of decrease in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas, which played a dominant role in PM reduction. Significant reductions in PM concentrations were observed in urban core areas, suburbs, towns and regions with high agricultural pressure. The interpretability analysis showed that temperature and interannual variability were the main drivers of PM pollution reduction. However, only interannual variability showed a significant decreasing trend in its effect on PM pollution, while other driving factors showed periodic variations. Furthermore, there were differences in the drivers of PM reduction between urban and rural areas, particularly with interannual variability in particular contributing to PM pollution reduction in urban areas, but having a lesser impact in most rural areas. This study reveals the urban-rural patterns of PM pollution reduction in eastern China, and highlights the need for differentiated air pollution control strategies in urban and rural areas.

## 193. RGB to Infrared Image Translation Based on Diffusion Bridges Under Aerial Perspective

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223703](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223703)

**摘要**:

Infrared images have garnered significant interest due to their superior performance, driving extensive research on visible-to-infrared image translation. However, existing cross-domain generation methods lack specialization for infrared image generation under aerial perspective, leading to distribution inconsistencies between synthetic and real infrared images and failing to mitigate challenges like small-target blurring and background interference under aerial views. To address these issues, we propose an RGB-to-infrared image generation method based on the Brownian bridge diffusion model for aerial perspective. Technically, we optimize the diffusion coefficient and variance scheduling of the Brownian bridge by introducing a parabolic function, design a Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) loss that fuses high-, medium-, and low-frequency features, and construct two core modules: a modality enhancement module that integrates spectral involution and cross-modal fusion, and an information guidance module based on wavelet decomposition. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: the method achieves a PSNR of 15.06 and an SSIM of 49.47, which are 1.5% and 1.2% higher than the suboptimal baseline BBDM-VQ4, respectively; its FID is reduced to 36.83, representing a 25.6% decrease compared to BBDM-VQ4, and its LPIPS is 2.0% lower than that of BBDM-VQ4. This approach effectively eliminates distribution biases induced by small-target blurring and background interference under aerial perspective while ensuring the semantic consistency of generated infrared images.

**摘要**:

The mammalian brain comprises numerous anatomical regions with distinct functions despite their extensive connectivity. However, how spontaneous neural activity is coordinated across regions over the circadian cycle remains elusive. We employed tissue clearing and whole-brain c-Fos immunostaining on 144 mouse brains collected over two days under constant darkness. Time-series analysis revealed brain-wide circadian rhythmicity at single-cell resolution, with 79% of the 642 anatomically defined regions oscillating in diverse circadian phases that delineate functional specializations. Voxel-wise analyses further highlighted distinct subregions, suggesting intricate spatiotemporal coordination within regions. Additionally, brain circadian time can be accurately inferred from global c-Fos patterns using omics-derived prediction methods. This whole-brain circadian atlas enhances our understanding of neural coordination and provides a resource for integrating time-of-day information into functional and pharmacological research.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI) is a Fourier Transform Spectrometer onboard the Eumetsat MetOp (Meteorological Operational) polar orbit satellite series. The three MetOp satellites (A, B, and C) were launched in October 2006, September 2012 and November 2018, respectively. IASI-B and IASI-C are still operational, while IASI-A was decommissioned in November 2021. IASI's mission is to provide accurate atmospheric spectra primarily for meteorological and climate applications, and as such a high measurement precision is required. Furthermore, the estimation of the measurement uncertainty is a valuable element, especially concerning climate studies and the establishment of long climate series. This study presents the global radiometric uncertainty budget as estimated for the IASI instruments. Four major contributors, the correction of the analog non-linearity, the black body characterization, the scan mirror reflectivity, and the background radiance instability, have been identified and their impact is presented alongside other minor contributors. For black body or earth view scenes under investigation, the global budget was found to be lower than 0.2 K for a reference temperature of 280 K, when all uncertainties were considered fully correlated. These estimates are expected to remain relatively stable throughout the instrument lifetime.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Aerosols influence the Earth's radiative balance through direct interactions with radiation and by affecting cloud properties. Anthropogenic aerosols have led to cooling during the industrial era through aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI), including aerosol effects on cloud microphysical properties and the subsequent adjustments. However, large uncertainties remain in Earth system models (ESMs) regarding the magnitude of this cooling. In part, ESMs substantially disagree on cloud properties, thermodynamics, the hydrological cycle, and general circulation. Reanalysis provides a useful avenue for exploring the impact of ACI on clouds and radiation because its atmosphere is forced to match realistic conditions through the assimilation of observations. Here, we explore the impact of ACI on clouds in the GiOcean reanalysis – the first to incorporate aerosol-cloud interactions. We contrast variables important for ACI between GiOcean and satellite observations and develop 2-dimensional lookup tables of ACI for both using a source-sink budget perspective to attribute the changes in cloud droplet number (Nd) and liquid water path (LWP) to aerosol and meteorology. A compositing analysis using lookup tables shows that GiOcean captures key aspects of aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions, including (1) activation of aerosol into cloud droplets, (2) effective precipitation scavenging of Nd, (3) suppression of precipitation by high Nd in regions with heavy aerosol emissions. In contrast, satellite observations do not exhibit clear patterns for processes (2) and (3). Random Forest analysis shows that interannual variability in Nd and LWP over the Northern Hemisphere ocean in GiOcean is primarily driven by precipitation, consistent with satellite observations.

**摘要**:

Verticillium wilt (VW) is a soil-borne disease that threatens cotton growth and yield. Resistance assessment is crucial for breeding VW-resistant varieties. Drone remote sensing technology has been used to achieve high-throughput resistance evaluation based on late-stage disease severity. However, the timing and progression of disease onset vary considerably among varieties with different resistance levels, and current methods do not adequately address the influence of the disease development rate during the early stage, making it difficult to systematically assess variety resistance levels. We employed temporal differential feature analysis methods (Cohen’s d and Sequential Backward Selection), combined with dynamic development rates, to identify hyperspectral characteristics that indicate the dynamic responses of resistant cotton varieties during VW disease progression. We observed that the bottom-up development characteristics of VW resulted in challenges in early-stage disease evaluation, as symptoms were not apparent on the upper leaves. After incorporating evaluation features that combined the dynamic disease development rate, the accuracy of the evaluation model during the early stage of the disease significantly improved, with a precision of 100%, a recall of 66.7%, and an F1-Score of 80%, effectively distinguishing varieties with different resistance levels. This study presents an efficient and accurate screening method for assessing VW resistance in cotton, thereby establishing a reliable foundation for informed disease-resistant breeding strategies.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The finite element method (FEM) is one of the most important and ubiquitous numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on computers for scientific and engineering discovery. Applying the FEM to larger and more detailed scientific models has driven advances in high-performance computing for decades. Here we demonstrate that scalable spiking neuromorphic hardware can directly implement the FEM by constructing a spiking neural network that solves the large, sparse, linear systems of equations at the core of the FEM. We show that for the Poisson equation, a fundamental PDE in science and engineering, our neural circuit achieves meaningful levels of numerical accuracy and close to ideal scaling on modern, inherently parallel and energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware, specifically Intel’s Loihi 2 neuromorphic platform. We illustrate extensions to irregular mesh geometries in both two and three dimensions as well as other PDEs such as linear elasticity. Our spiking neural network is constructed from a recurrent network model of the brain’s motor cortex and, in contrast to black-box deep artificial neural network-based methods for PDEs, directly translates the well-understood and trusted mathematics of the FEM to a natively spiking neuromorphic algorithm.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The standard sea ice viscous-plastic (VP) rheology is based on an elliptical yield curve and a normal flow rule. This formulation implies that the post-failure deformations are always normal to the yield curve. A drawback of this is that modifications to the yield curve also lead to notable changes to the deformations. We implemented the plastic potential approach of Ringeisen et al. (2021) in the CICE sea ice model. With this formulation, deformations are normal to an elliptical plastic potential which is defined independently from the yield curve. This an interesting capability as it allows to independently optimize deformations while parameters defining the yield curve could serve to adjust landfast ice and to a lesser extent sea ice drift. We investigated the impact of a non-normal flow rule in pan-Arctic simulations. Compared to the standard VP rheology, the non-normal flow rule leads to a more active sea ice cover with narrower linear kinematic features (LKFs) and a higher LKF density. The higher divergence with the non-normal flow rule causes an enhanced ice growth and larger Arctic sea ice volume. In idealized experiments, Ringeisen et al. (2021) showed that the non-normal flow rule can correct the unrealistic (too large) intersection angles between LKFs. However, in our pan-Arctic simulations, the non-normal flow rule does not correct the unrealistic intersection angles which are often around 90°. Results suggest that these frequent 90° angles are partly caused by the alignment of LKFs with the computational grid.

**摘要**:

Abstract. MechGen is a software system designed to derive gas-phase reaction mechanisms for reactive organic compounds under atmospherically relevant conditions for use in chemical models and for data analysis and interpretation. It has been used to derive versions of the SAPRC mechanisms used in airshed models, with SAPRC-22 being the most recent. MechGen derives fully explicit mechanisms for many types of organic compounds and their oxidation products when they react in the atmosphere in the presence of oxides of nitrogen and other pollutants and then uses these explicit mechanisms to derive reduced or lumped mechanisms more suitable for use in airshed models. This paper gives an overview of the system, describes the procedures it uses to generate explicit and reduced mechanisms, and presents several types of applications. The assignments and estimates used to derive individual chemical reactions and assign rate constants are discussed in a separate companion paper. The system is publicly accessible for generating explicit mechanisms for single compounds and viewing associated documentation using a web-based interface. A separate terminal login is available for deriving mechanisms for multiple compounds, multi-generation mechanisms, and portions of lumped mechanisms for airshed models, as well as for system programming and management. MechGen is designed to accommodate updates to the chemical estimates and assignments that it uses to reflect our evolving knowledge of and ability to estimate atmospheric reactions of organic compounds.

## 208. Bridging Vision Foundation and Vision–Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation of UAV Imagery

**作者**: Fan Li, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Xuanbin Wang, Xuan Wang, Yuelei Xu

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223704](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223704)

**摘要**:

Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is of critical importance for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, as UAV scenes are highly dynamic and characterized by diverse, unpredictable object categories. Current OVSS approaches mainly rely on the zero-shot capabilities of vision–language models (VLMs), but their image-level pretraining objectives yield ambiguous spatial relationships and coarse-grained feature representations, resulting in suboptimal performance in UAV scenes. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid framework for OVSS in UAV imagery, named HOSU, which leverages the priors of vision foundation models to unleash the potential of vision–language models in representing complex spatial distributions and capturing fine-grained small-object details in UAV scenes. Specifically, we propose a distribution-aware fine-tuning method that aligns CLIP with DINOv2 across intra- and inter-region feature distributions, enhancing the capacity of CLIP to model complex scene semantics and capture fine-grained details critical for UAV imagery. Meanwhile, we propose a text-guided multi-level regularization mechanism that leverages the text embeddings of CLIP to impose semantic constraints on the visual features, preventing their drift from the original semantic space during fine-tuning and ensuring stable vision–language correspondence. Finally, to address the pervasive occlusion in UAV imagery, we propose a mask-based feature consistency strategy that enables the model to learn stable representations, remaining robust against viewpoint-induced occlusions. Extensive experiments across four training settings on six UAV datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous methods, while comprehensive ablation studies and analyses further validate its effectiveness.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The Mediterranean basin, a recognized climate change hotspot, faces increasing hydroclimatic pressures, particularly from severe drought and precipitation events. To assess contemporary changes and potentially manage future impacts, it is crucial to understand the long-term context of this variability beyond the relatively short instrumental record. This study utilizes tree-ring records to reconstruct past hydroclimate in the Iberian Range of eastern Spain, a water-sensitive Mediterranean environment. We present a well-replicated tree-ring width chronology from Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra trees that calibrates and verifies significantly against cumulative instrumental precipitation over a 320 d period ending in June (r = 0.749; p &lt; 0.01). The resulting 520-year reconstruction reveals substantial multi-centennial variability in precipitation and reveals an increase in the frequency and intensity of hydroclimatic extremes (both wet and dry) during the late 20th and early 21st centuries compared to the longer-term baseline. The reconstruction has a spatial representativeness centred over eastern and central Iberia and covaries with independent historical drought indices derived from rogation ceremony records during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The documented intensification of hydroclimatic extremes is consistent with climate change projections and provides a baseline for evaluating ecosystem resilience and water resource vulnerability.

                  This study investigates the influence of natural external forcing over the last millennium (950–1850) on global land monsoon variability at decadal scale. Two major players operate through changes in global mean surface temperature (GMST) and in the tropical Pacific temperature gradient (TPTG). They modulate precipitation, either individually or jointly in the form of cool-GMST and weak-TPTG episodes. A diagnostic with moisture budget decomposition is performed to separate dynamic and thermodynamic contributions leading to monsoon precipitation. Cool-GMST primarily suppresses the summer precipitation via thermodynamic contributions, with a complex winter response featuring competing thermodynamic gains and evaporation losses. In contrast, weak-TPTG involves significant dynamic adjustments, driving an inter-hemispheric dipole for the summer land monsoon precipitation: decreases in the Northern Hemisphere via anomalous subsidence, and increases in the Southern Hemisphere via the thermodynamic contributions and evaporation. The enhanced winter monsoon precipitation (especially in the Southern Hemisphere) in the case of weak-TPTG is largely driven by the dynamics and evaporation. Under compound conditions, the overall monsoon intensity response can be largely interpreted as a linear superposition of the individual drivers. Summer precipitation is substantially reduced, primarily due to cooling-induced thermodynamic suppression, with additional dynamic contributions. The winter response shows a distinct inter-hemispheric pattern, with precipitation increasing in the Southern Hemisphere and slightly decreasing in the Northern Hemisphere, reflecting different controls by cool-GMST and weak-TPTG. This study provides a valuable framework for interpreting the past monsoon variability and projecting its future variation.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Observational data availability, quality, and access are major obstacles to hydrological science and innovation. To alleviate these issues, major investments are being made in hydrological monitoring infrastructures to enable data collection and sharing at unprecedented scales and resolution. These projects integrate a range of complex physical and digital components, which require careful design to prioritise the needs of end-users and optimise their value delivery. We present here the findings of multiple-methods research on end-user needs for a GBP 38 million hydrological monitoring and research infrastructure in the UK, integrating a systematic literature review of common user-requirements with interviews of 20 national stakeholders. We find a demand for infrastructures that complement their provision of baseline hydrological datasets, where feasible, with additional services designed specifically to enable wider and more decentralised data collection. This can unlock the capacities of user communities by addressing barriers to data collection through, for example, the provision of land access, reliable benchmark datasets, equipment rental and technical support. Similarly, value can be unlocked by providing data management services, including data access, storage, quality control, processing, visualisation and communication. Our respondents further consider digital and physical spaces where users can collaborate to be critical for incubating genuine value to science and innovation. We conclude that new hydrological monitoring infrastructures require concurrent investments to build and nurture associated user, research and innovation communities, where specific enabling support is provided to facilitate collaborations. Supplementing digital and monitoring services with support for data collection and collaboration among active, value-generating user communities can produce multiplier effects from initial capital investments, by attracting longer-term contributions of ideas, methods, findings, technologies, data, training and investments from their beneficiaries.

**摘要**:

As the first domestic species, dogs likely dispersed with different cultural groups during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 73 ancient dog genomes, including 17 newly sequenced individuals sampled from East Asia to the West Eurasian Steppe spanning nearly 10,000 years. Our results indicate correlations between the ancestry of dogs and specific ancient human populations from eastern Europe to Eastern Siberia, including Ancient Paleo-Siberians, Eastern hunter-gatherers, East Asians, and Steppe pastoralists. We also identify multiple shifts in the ancestry of dogs that coincide with specific dispersals of hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists. Combined, our results reveal the long-term and integral role that dogs played in a multitude of human societies.

**摘要**:

Systemic drug administration often causes off-target effects, limiting the efficacy of advanced therapies. Targeted drug delivery approaches increase local drug concentrations at the diseased site while minimizing systemic drug exposure. We present a magnetically guided microrobotic drug delivery platform capable of precise navigation under physiological conditions. This platform integrates a clinical electromagnetic navigation system, a custom-designed release catheter, and a dissolvable capsule for accurate therapeutic delivery. In vitro tests showed precise navigation in human vasculature models, and in vivo experiments confirmed tracking under fluoroscopy and successful navigation in large animal models. The microrobot balances magnetic material concentration, contrast agent loading, and therapeutic drug capacity, offering a promising solution for precise targeted drug delivery.

## 223. Crustal-upper mantle velocity structure from the North Qilian Shan to Beishan Orogenic Collage: tectonic significance of crustal deformation

**摘要**:

Abstract. The Qilian Shan represents a Cenozoic fold-thrust belt characterized by multi-stage tectonic deformation since the Paleozoic. North of it lies the Hexi corridor basins and the Beishan Orogenic Collage (BOC), which constitute the southern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. The crustal-mantle structure of the study area, a transition zone, is crucial to understanding the deep processes of accretion and crustal deformation. This study presents a newly acquired 460 km wide-angle reflection and refraction profile traversing from the North Qilian Shan to the BOC. P-wave velocity structure reveals a 47.5–60 km thick crust divided into five layers. The deepest Moho (60 km) lies beneath the central Jiuquan. Average crustal velocities (6.24–6.43 km s−1) and Pn values (7.7–8.1 km s−1) reveal strong lateral heterogeneity. North-dipping velocity contours from 20 km to the uppermost mantle beneath the Qilian Shan, coupled with a lower-crust–upper-mantle low-velocity corridor beneath the Hexi Basin, support early Paleozoic north-dipping subduction of the Qilian Ocean. A positive upper-mantle anomaly (8.0–8.3 km s−1, 45–70 km depth) aligns with the Hongliuhe–Xichangjing ophiolite mélange likely represents a fossil slab broken off after north-dipping subduction of the Beishan Ocean. Crustal velocity contrasts across the southern margin fault of the Beishan affirms its role as a regional strike-slip structure. Integrating geological and geophysical evidence, we suggest that the Altyn Tagh Fault does not terminate at the Qilian Shan front but rather extends east-northeast along the southern margin of the BOC into the Beishan and Alxa regions.

## 225. High-resolution soil moisture mapping in northern boreal forests using SMAP data and downscaling techniques

**摘要**:

Abstract. Soil moisture plays an important part in predicting different forest-related phenomena, such as tree growth or forest fire risk. As they influence the carbon storage capacity of boreal forest ecosystems, it is crucial to provide soil moisture information at high spatio-temporal scales. Current satellite-based soil moisture products often have high temporal resolution at the expense of spatial resolution. Therefore, we developed a machine-learning-based model to estimate soil moisture at high spatial resolution over boreal forested areas for the annual time period from May to October, while retaining the high temporal resolution. The basis data of the model is the 36 km spatial resolution soil moisture data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. Additionally, vegetation properties, weather-related parameters, and measured in situ soil moisture data are used to guide the model construction process. The analysis of the developed model shows that it retains the temporal and large-scale spatial variability of SMAP soil moisture. Furthermore, comparisons with the independent in situ soil moisture data indicate that the model's predictions align more closely with in situ values than SMAP soil moisture, as RMSE decreases from 0.103 to 0.092 m3 m−3 , and correlation increases from 0.46 to 0.55 over forest sites. Therefore, this machine-learning-based model can be used to predict high-resolution soil moisture over boreal forested areas.

**摘要**:

Genetic disruption of the RAS binding domain (RBD) of phosphoinositide 3-kinase alpha (PI3Kα) impairs the growth of tumors driven by the small guanosine triphosphatase RAS in mice and does not affect PI3Kα’s role in insulin-mediated control of glucose homeostasis. Selectively blocking the RAS-PI3Kα interaction may represent a strategy for treating RAS-dependent cancers as it avoids the toxicity associated with inhibitors of PI3Kα lipid kinase activity. We developed compounds that bind covalently to cysteine 242 in the RBD of PI3K p110α and block RAS activation of PI3Kα activity. In mice, inhibitors slow the growth of RAS mutant tumors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–overexpressing tumors, particularly when combined with other inhibitors of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, without causing hyperglycemia.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  There is increasing concern that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will start to collapse this century having disrupting societal impacts worldwide. Although several available reconstructions appear to indicate a gradual weakening of the AMOC over the last century, the proximity to a possible tipping point associated with the onset of the collapse remains unknown. Here, we use results of an AMOC collapse, simulated in the Community Earth System Model (CESM), to identify currently observed regions and variables that can serve as early warning signals for this collapse. Optimal regions are identified using equilibrium CESM simulations and quasi‐equilibrium forcing conditions. Salinity data near the southern boundary of the Atlantic Ocean turn out to give optimal early warning signals for the AMOC collapse in the CESM and provide adequate estimates of its onset time. The results are important for the design of a future early warning system of AMOC tipping.

## 232. A General Anchor-Based Framework for Scalable Fair Clustering

**作者**: Shengfei Wei, Suyuan Liu, Jun Wang, Ke Liang, Miaomiao Li, Lei Luo

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09889v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09889v1)

**摘要**:

Fair clustering is crucial for mitigating bias in unsupervised learning, yet existing algorithms often suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic computational complexity, rendering them impractical for large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that AFCF drastically accelerates state-of-the-art methods, which reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while maintaining strong clustering performance and fairness guarantees.

## 233. Scale-Aware Relay and Scale-Adaptive Loss for Tiny Object Detection in Aerial Images

**作者**: Jinfu Li, Yuqi Huang, Hong Song, Ting Wang, Jianghan Xia, Yucong Lin, Jingfan Fan, Jian Yang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09891v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09891v1)

**摘要**:

Recently, despite the remarkable advancements in object detection, modern detectors still struggle to detect tiny objects in aerial images. One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019), and the results demonstrate that the proposed method boosts the generalization ability by 5.5\% Average Precision (AP) when embedded in YOLOv5 (anchor-based) and YOLOx (anchor-free) baselines. Moreover, it also promotes the robust performance with 29.0\% AP on the real-world noisy dataset (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD-v2.0).

**摘要**:

Automated medical image captioning translates complex radiological images into diagnostic narratives that can support reporting workflows. We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.

**摘要**:

Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are critical to patient survival in emergencies, but first responders often face intense cognitive demands in high-stakes situations. AI cognitive assistants, acting as virtual partners, have the potential to ease this burden by supporting real-time data collection and decision making. In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks. Emphasizing realism, the dataset includes responder-patient interactions reflecting real-world emergency dynamics. We also present a suite of benchmarks for real-time multimodal keystep recognition and action quality estimation, essential for developing AI support tools for EMS. We hope EgoEMS inspires the research community to push the boundaries of intelligent EMS systems and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes.

## 236. Simulator and Experience Enhanced Diffusion Model for Comprehensive ECG Generation

**作者**: Xiaoda Wang, Kaiqiao Han, Yuhao Xu, Xiao Luo, Yizhou Sun, Wei Wang, Carl Yang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09895v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09895v1)

**摘要**:

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.

## 237. Theory and computation for structured variational inference

**作者**: Shunan Sheng, Bohan Wu, Bennett Zhu, Sinho Chewi, Aram-Alexandre Pooladian

**期刊**: arXiv [stat.ML]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09897v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09897v1)

**摘要**:

Structured variational inference constitutes a core methodology in modern statistical applications. Unlike mean-field variational inference, the approximate posterior is assumed to have interdependent structure. We consider the natural setting of star-structured variational inference, where a root variable impacts all the other ones. We prove the first results for existence, uniqueness, and self-consistency of the variational approximation. In turn, we derive quantitative approximation error bounds for the variational approximation to the posterior, extending prior work from the mean-field setting to the star-structured setting. We also develop a gradient-based algorithm with provable guarantees for computing the variational approximation using ideas from optimal transport theory. We explore the implications of our results for Gaussian measures and hierarchical Bayesian models, including generalized linear models with location family priors and spike-and-slab priors with one-dimensional debiasing. As a by-product of our analysis, we develop new stability results for star-separable transport maps which might be of independent interest.

## 238. Electromagnetic Quantitative Inversion for Translationally Moving Targets via Phase Correlation Registration of Back-Projection Images

**作者**: Yitao Lin, Dahai Dai, Shilong Sun, Yuchen Wu, Bo Pang

**期刊**: arXiv [eess.IV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09898v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09898v1)

**摘要**:

An novel electromagnetic quantitative inversion scheme for translationally moving targets via phase correlation registration of back-projection (BP) images is proposed. Based on a time division multiplexing multiple-input multiple-output (TDM-MIMO) radar architecture, the scheme first achieves high-precision relative positioning of the target, then applies relative motion compensation to perform iterative inversion on multi-cycle MIMO measurement data, thereby reconstructing the target's electromagnetic parameters. As a general framework compatible with other mainstream inversion algorithms, we exemplify our approach by incorporating the classical cross-correlated contrast source inversion (CC-CSI) into iterative optimization step of the scheme, resulting in a new algorithm termed RMC-CC-CSI. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that RMC-CC-CSI offers accelerated convergence, enhanced reconstruction fidelity, and improved noise immunity over conventional CC-CSI for stationary targets despite increased computational cost.

## 239. Boosting In-Silicon Directed Evolution with Fine-Tuned Protein Language Model and Tree Search

**作者**: Yaodong Yang, Yang Wang, Jinpeng Li, Pei Guo, Da Han, Guangyong Chen, Pheng-Ann Heng

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09900v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09900v1)

**摘要**:

Protein evolution through amino acid sequence mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.

## 240. Explore and Establish Synergistic Effects Between Weight Pruning and Coreset Selection in Neural Network Training

**作者**: Weilin Wan, Fan Yi, Weizhong Zhang, Quan Zhou, Cheng Jin

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09901v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09901v1)

**摘要**:

Modern deep neural networks rely heavily on massive model weights and training samples, incurring substantial computational costs. Weight pruning and coreset selection are two emerging paradigms proposed to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we first explore the interplay between redundant weights and training samples through a transparent analysis: redundant samples, particularly noisy ones, cause model weights to become unnecessarily overtuned to fit them, complicating the identification of irrelevant weights during pruning; conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, undermining coreset selection effectiveness. To further investigate and harness this interplay in deep learning, we develop a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection to establish a synergistic effect in training. During this investigation, we observe that when simultaneously removing a large number of weights and samples, a phenomenon we term critical double-loss can occur, where important weights and their supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated at the same time, leading to model instability and nearly irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered in subsequent training. Unlike classic machine learning models, this issue can arise in deep learning due to the lack of theoretical guarantees on the correctness of weight pruning and coreset selection, which explains why these paradigms are often developed independently. We mitigate this by integrating a state preservation mechanism into SWaST, enabling stable joint optimization. Extensive experiments reveal a strong synergy between pruning and coreset selection across varying prune rates and coreset sizes, delivering accuracy boosts of up to 17.83% alongside 10% to 90% FLOPs reductions.

## 241. Incremental Generation is Necessity and Sufficient for Universality in Flow-Based Modelling

**作者**: Hossein Rouhvarzi, Anastasis Kratsios

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09902v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09902v1)

**摘要**:

Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.

**摘要**:

AI systems are increasingly able to autonomously conduct realistic software engineering tasks, and may soon be deployed to automate machine learning (ML) R&D itself. Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains. Our benchmark is implemented in the UK AISI's Inspect framework and we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/samm393/mlebench-subversion

**arXiv**: [2511.09905v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09905v1)

**摘要**:

Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

## 244. Beyond empirical models: Discovering new constitutive laws in solids with graph-based equation discovery

**作者**: Hao Xu, Yuntian Chen, Dongxiao Zhang

**期刊**: arXiv [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09906v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09906v1)

**摘要**:

Constitutive models are fundamental to solid mechanics and materials science, underpinning the quantitative description and prediction of material responses under diverse loading conditions. Traditional phenomenological models, which are derived through empirical fitting, often lack generalizability and rely heavily on expert intuition and predefined functional forms. In this work, we propose a graph-based equation discovery framework for the automated discovery of constitutive laws directly from multisource experimental data. This framework expresses equations as directed graphs, where nodes represent operators and variables, edges denote computational relations, and edge features encode parametric dependencies. This enables the generation and optimization of free-form symbolic expressions with undetermined material-specific parameters. Through the proposed framework, we have discovered new constitutive models for strain-rate effects in alloy steel materials and the deformation behavior of lithium metal. Compared with conventional empirical models, these new models exhibit compact analytical structures and achieve higher accuracy. The proposed graph-based equation discovery framework provides a generalizable and interpretable approach for data-driven scientific modelling, particularly in contexts where traditional empirical formulations are inadequate for representing complex physical phenomena.

**arXiv**: [2511.09907v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09907v1)

**摘要**:

Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

## 246. Simulating Distribution Dynamics: Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution for Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection

**作者**: Zihao Zhang, Yang Li, Aming Wu, Yahong Han

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09909v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09909v1)

**摘要**:

In this paper, we focus on Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD), aiming to transfer a detector trained on one source domain to multiple unknown domains. Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/2490o/LTFE.

**arXiv**: [2511.09914v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09914v1)

**摘要**:

The opioid crisis represents a significant moment in public health that reveals systemic shortcomings across regulatory systems, healthcare practices, corporate governance, and public policy. Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks. The dataset and models are publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/opioidarchive

**arXiv**: [2511.09915v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09915v1)

**摘要**:

To provide a unified and flexible solution for daily communication among hearing-impaired individuals, we introduce the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology and present HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual personal assistant. The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion. Experiments on our purpose-built HI-Dialogue dataset show that HI-TransPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity. This work establishes a foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology, providing an end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools for future research.

## 249. Towards Multiple Missing Values-resistant Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection

**作者**: Jiazhen Chen, Xiuqin Liang, Sichao Fu, Zheng Ma, Weihua Ou

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09917v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09917v1)

**摘要**:

Unsupervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) has received increasing attention in recent years, which aims to identify data anomalous patterns utilizing only unlabeled node information from graph-structured data. However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk "repairing" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.

## 250. MINDS: A Cross-cultural Dialogue Corpus for Social Norm Classification and Adherence Detection

**作者**: Pritish Sahu, Anirudh Som, Dimitra Vergyri, Ajay Divakaran

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09918v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09918v1)

**摘要**:

Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

## 251. MosaicDoc: A Large-Scale Bilingual Benchmark for Visually Rich Document Understanding

**作者**: Ketong Chen, Yuhao Chen, Yang Xue

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09919v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09919v1)

**摘要**:

Despite the rapid progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capabilities are inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks, which are predominantly English-centric, feature simplistic layouts, and support limited tasks. Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU. Sourced from newspapers and magazines, MosaicDoc features diverse and complex layouts (including multi-column and non-Manhattan), rich stylistic variety from 196 publishers, and comprehensive multi-task annotations (OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization). With 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for the field. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their current limitations in handling real-world document complexity and charts a clear path for future research.

## 252. Adaptive Hyperbolic Kernels: Modulated Embedding in de Branges-Rovnyak Spaces

**作者**: Leping Si, Meimei Yang, Hui Xue, Shipeng Zhu, Pengfei Fang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09921v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09921v1)

**摘要**:

Hierarchical data pervades diverse machine learning applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and social network analysis. Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.

## 253. Harnessing Bounded-Support Evolution Strategies for Policy Refinement

**作者**: Ethan Hirschowitz, Fabio Ramos

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09923v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09923v1)

**摘要**:

Improving competent robot policies with on-policy RL is often hampered by noisy, low-signal gradients. We revisit Evolution Strategies (ES) as a policy-gradient proxy and localize exploration with bounded, antithetic triangular perturbations, suitable for policy refinement. We propose Triangular-Distribution ES (TD-ES) which pairs bounded triangular noise with a centered-rank finite-difference estimator to deliver stable, parallelizable, gradient-free updates. In a two-stage pipeline -- PPO pretraining followed by TD-ES refinement -- this preserves early sample efficiency while enabling robust late-stage gains. Across a suite of robotic manipulation tasks, TD-ES raises success rates by 26.5% relative to PPO and greatly reduces variance, offering a simple, compute-light path to reliable refinement.

## 254. MDMLP-EIA: Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention for Time Series Forecasting

**作者**: Hu Zhang, Zhien Dai, Zhaohui Tang, Yongfang Xie

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09924v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09924v1)

**摘要**:

Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

## 255. Global Convergence of Four-Layer Matrix Factorization under Random Initialization

**作者**: Minrui Luo, Weihang Xu, Xiang Gao, Maryam Fazel, Simon Shaolei Du

**期刊**: arXiv [math.OC]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09925v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09925v1)

**摘要**:

Gradient descent dynamics on the deep matrix factorization problem is extensively studied as a simplified theoretical model for deep neural networks. Although the convergence theory for two-layer matrix factorization is well-established, no global convergence guarantee for general deep matrix factorization under random initialization has been established to date. To address this gap, we provide a polynomial-time global convergence guarantee for randomly initialized gradient descent on four-layer matrix factorization, given certain conditions on the target matrix and a standard balanced regularization term. Our analysis employs new techniques to show saddle-avoidance properties of gradient decent dynamics, and extends previous theories to characterize the change in eigenvalues of layer weights.

## 256. Compensating Distribution Drifts in Class-incremental Learning of Pre-trained Vision Transformers

**作者**: Xuan Rao, Simian Xu, Zheng Li, Bo Zhao, Derong Liu, Mingming Ha, Cesare Alippi

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09926v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09926v1)

**摘要**:

Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

## 257. Debiased Dual-Invariant Defense for Adversarially Robust Person Re-Identification

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09933v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09933v1)

**摘要**:

Person re-identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in many real-world applications such as pedestrian trajectory tracking. However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.

## 258. Leveraging Large Language Models for Identifying Knowledge Components

**作者**: Canwen Wang, Jionghao Lin, Kenneth R. Koedinger

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09935v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09935v1)

**摘要**:

Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

**作者**: Mustafa Munir, Md Mostafijur Rahman, Radu Marculescu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09942v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09942v1)

**摘要**:

Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer a new direction for advancements in vision architectures. While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.

## 260. TSPE-GS: Probabilistic Depth Extraction for Semi-Transparent Surface Reconstruction via 3D Gaussian Splatting

**作者**: Zhiyuan Xu, Nan Min, Yuhang Guo, Tong Wei

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09944v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09944v1)

**摘要**:

3D Gaussian Splatting offers a strong speed-quality trade-off but struggles to reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces because most methods assume a single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible. We propose TSPE-GS (Transparent Surface Probabilistic Extraction for Gaussian Splatting), which uniformly samples transmittance to model a pixel-wise multi-modal distribution of opacity and depth, replacing the prior single-peak assumption and resolving cross-surface depth ambiguity. By progressively fusing truncated signed distance functions, TSPE-GS reconstructs external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework. The method generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected semi-transparent and opaque datasets show TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes.

**arXiv**: [2511.09947v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09947v1)

**摘要**:

Scalable and generalizable analysis of brain activity is essential for advancing both clinical diagnostics and cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis. However, most existing EEG models are usually tailored for individual specific tasks, limiting their utility in realistic scenarios where EEG analysis often involves multi-task and continuous reasoning. In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation. To realize these capabilities, we design a toolbox composed of different tools for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, etc. These capabilities were evaluated on public datasets, and our EEGAgent can support flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.

**摘要**:

Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.

**arXiv**: [2511.09952v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09952v1)

**摘要**:

Inverse problems in imaging are typically ill-posed and are usually solved by employing regularized optimization techniques. The usage of appropriate constraints can restrict the solution space, thus making it feasible for a reconstruction algorithm to find a meaningful solution. In recent years, deep network based ideas aimed at learning the end-to-end mapping between the raw measurements and the target image have gained popularity. In the learning approach, the functional relationship between the measured raw data and the solution image are learned by training a deep network with prior examples. While this approach allows one to significantly increase the real-time operational speed, it does not change the nature of the underlying ill-posed inverse problem. It is well-known that availability of diverse non-redundant data via additional measurements can generically improve the robustness of the reconstruction algorithms. The multiple data measurements, however, typically demand additional hardware and complex system setups that are not desirable. In this work, we note that in both incoherent and coherent optical imaging, the irradiance patterns corresponding to two phase diverse measurements associated with the same test object have implicit local correlation which may be learned. A physics informed data augmentation scheme is then described where a trained network is used for generating a phase diverse pseudo-data based on a ground truth data frame. The true data along with the augmented pesudo-data are observed to provide high quality inverse solutions with simpler reconstruction algorithms. We validate this approach for both incoherent and coherent optical imaging (or phase retrieval) configurations with vortex phase as a diversity mechanism. Our results may open new avenues for leaner high-fidelity computational imaging systems across a broad range of applications.

## 264. Autonomous Concept Drift Threshold Determination

**作者**: Pengqian Lu, Jie Lu, Anjin Liu, En Yu, Guangquan Zhang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09953v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09953v1)

**摘要**:

Existing drift detection methods focus on designing sensitive test statistics. They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted. Extensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including both image and tabular data, validate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors.

**arXiv**: [2511.09955v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09955v1)

**摘要**:

Foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs), offer compelling zero-shot object detection for applications like autonomous driving, a domain where manual labelling is prohibitively expensive. However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset. We observe similar performance improvements for the ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

## 266. AI-Integrated Decision Support System for Real-Time Market Growth Forecasting and Multi-Source Content Diffusion Analytics

**作者**: Ziqing Yin, Xuanjing Chen, Xi Zhang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09962v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09962v1)

**摘要**:

The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) has reshaped the dynamics of digital marketing and online consumer behavior. However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09964v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09964v1)

**摘要**:

Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for instrument control requires methods that go beyond standard, stateless algorithmic benchmarks, since the behavior of physical systems cannot be fully captured by unit tests alone. Here we introduce EnvTrace, a simulation-based method that evaluates execution traces to assess semantic code equivalence. EnvTrace is demonstrated with a beamline control-logic digital twin to facilitate the evaluation of instrument control code, with the digital twin itself also enabling the pre-execution validation of live experiments. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation. This is a first step toward a broader vision where LLMs and digital twins work symbiotically: LLMs providing intuitive control and agentic orchestration, and digital twins offering safe and high-fidelity environments, paving the way towards autonomous embodied AI.

**arXiv**: [2511.09965v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09965v1)

**摘要**:

Recent advances in generative models, especially diffusion models, have significantly improved image restoration (IR) performance. However, existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration (DMIR) methods face challenges in fully leveraging diffusion priors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR methods by analyzing their sampling process and providing effective solutions. We introduce EquS, a DMIR method that imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories. To further boost EquS, we propose the Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) and introduce EquS$^+$. TAS prioritizes deterministic steps to enhance certainty and sampling efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method is compatible with previous problem-agnostic DMIR methods and significantly boosts their performance without increasing computational costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/FouierL/EquS.

## 269. REAP: Enhancing RAG with Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning for Multi-Hop Question Answering

**作者**: Yijie Zhu, Haojie Zhou, Wanting Hong, Tailin Liu, Ning Wang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09966v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09966v1)

**摘要**:

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been extensively employed to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public multi-hop datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, validating its effectiveness in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

**DOI**: [10.1145/3770762.3772662](https://doi.org/10.1145/3770762.3772662)

**摘要**:

We present Owlgorithm, an educational platform that supports Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in competitive programming (CP) through AI-generated reflective questions. Leveraging GPT-4o, Owlgorithm produces context-aware, metacognitive prompts tailored to individual student submissions. Integrated into a second- and third-year CP course, the system-provided reflective prompts adapted to student outcomes: guiding deeper conceptual insight for correct solutions and structured debugging for partial or failed ones.
  Our exploratory assessment of student ratings and TA feedback revealed both promising benefits and notable limitations. While many found the generated questions useful for reflection and debugging, concerns were raised about feedback accuracy and classroom usability. These results suggest advantages of LLM-supported reflection for novice programmers, though refinements are needed to ensure reliability and pedagogical value for advanced learners.
  From our experience, several key insights emerged: GenAI can effectively support structured reflection, but careful prompt design, dynamic adaptation, and usability improvements are critical to realizing their potential in education. We offer specific recommendations for educators using similar tools and outline next steps to enhance Owlgorithm's educational impact. The underlying framework may also generalize to other reflective learning contexts.

**作者**: Dimitrios Sinodinos, Jack Yi Wei, Narges Armanfard

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09970v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09970v1)

**摘要**:

Tabular data is the most abundant data type in the world, powering systems in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and beyond. As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Armanfard-Lab/MultiTab.

**作者**: Peter Røysland Aarnes, Vinay Setty

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09971v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09971v1)

**摘要**:

Large language models show strong performance on knowledge intensive tasks such as fact-checking and question answering, yet they often struggle with numerical reasoning. We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models for veracity prediction on numerical claims and evidence pairs using controlled perturbations, including label-flipping probes, to test robustness. Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover. These findings highlight critical limitations in numerical fact-checking and suggest that robustness remains an open challenge for current language models.

**arXiv**: [2511.09973v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09973v1)

**摘要**:

Contrastive pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate strong generalization abilities in zero-shot classification by leveraging embeddings extracted from image and text encoders. This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09977v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09977v1)

**摘要**:

Scene Text Editing (STE) is the task of modifying text content in an image while preserving its visual style, such as font, color, and background. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images. We also construct a new dataset, STIPLAR(Scene Text Image Pairs of Low-resource lAnguages and Real-world data), for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose Text Appearance Similarity (TAS), a novel metric that assesses style preservation by independently measuring font, color, and background similarity, enabling robust evaluation even without ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that STELLAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving an average TAS improvement of 2.2% across languages over the baselines.

## 275. Rediscovering the Lunar Equation of the Centre with AI Feynman via Embedded Physical Biases

**作者**: Saumya Shah, Zi-Yu Khoo, Abel Yang, Stéphane Bressan

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09979v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09979v1)

**摘要**:

This work explores using the physics-inspired AI Feynman symbolic regression algorithm to automatically rediscover a fundamental equation in astronomy -- the Equation of the Centre. Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection. We therefore propose an automated preprocessing extension to find the canonical coordinate system. Results demonstrate that targeted domain knowledge embedding enables symbolic regression to rediscover physical laws, but also highlight further challenges in constraining symbolic regression to derive physics equations when leveraging domain knowledge through tailored biases.

## 276. Modeling Uncertainty Trends for Timely Retrieval in Dynamic RAG

**作者**: Bo Li, Tian Tian, Zhenghua Xu, Hao Cheng, Shikun Zhang, Wei Ye

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09980v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09980v1)

**摘要**:

Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.

## 277. Language Drift in Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Characterization and Decoding-Time Mitigation

**作者**: Bo Li, Zhenghua Xu, Rui Xie

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09984v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09984v1)

**摘要**:

Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge-intensive tasks in multilingual settings by leveraging retrieved documents as external evidence. However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.
  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.

## 278. Towards Robust Multimodal Learning in the Open World

**作者**: Fushuo Huo

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09989v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09989v1)

**摘要**:

The rapid evolution of machine learning has propelled neural networks to unprecedented success across diverse domains. In particular, multimodal learning has emerged as a transformative paradigm, leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous data streams (e.g., text, vision, audio) to advance contextual reasoning and intelligent decision-making. Despite these advancements, current neural network-based models often fall short in open-world environments characterized by inherent unpredictability, where unpredictable environmental composition dynamics, incomplete modality inputs, and spurious distributions relations critically undermine system reliability. While humans naturally adapt to such dynamic, ambiguous scenarios, artificial intelligence systems exhibit stark limitations in robustness, particularly when processing multimodal signals under real-world complexity. This study investigates the fundamental challenge of multimodal learning robustness in open-world settings, aiming to bridge the gap between controlled experimental performance and practical deployment requirements.

**作者**: Mehdi Zafari, A. Lee Swindlehurst

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09992v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09992v1)

**摘要**:

Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key emerging 6G technology. Despite progress, ISAC still lacks scalable methods for joint AP clustering and user/target scheduling in distributed deployments under fronthaul limits. Moreover, existing ISAC solutions largely rely on centralized processing and full channel state information, limiting scalability. This paper addresses joint access point (AP) clustering, user and target scheduling, and AP mode selection in distributed cell-free ISAC systems operating with constrained fronthaul capacity. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly captures interference coupling, RF-chain limits, and sensing requirements, providing optimal but computationally demanding solutions. To enable real-time and scalable operation, we propose ASSENT (ASSociation and ENTity selection), a graph neural network (GNN) framework trained on MILP solutions to efficiently learn association and mode-selection policies directly from lightweight link statistics. Simulations show that ASSENT achieves near-optimal utility while accurately learning the underlying associations. Additionally, its single forward pass inference reduces decision latency compared to optimization-based methods. An open-source Python/PyTorch implementation with full datasets is provided to facilitate reproducible and extensible research in cell-free ISAC.

## 280. SPAN: Benchmarking and Improving Cross-Calendar Temporal Reasoning of Large Language Models

**作者**: Zhongjian Miao, Hao Fu, Chen Wei

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09993v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09993v1)

**摘要**:

We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning. We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.

## 281. A Novel Data-Dependent Learning Paradigm for Large Hypothesis Classes

**作者**: Alireza F. Pour, Shai Ben-David

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09996v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09996v1)

**摘要**:

We address the general task of learning with a set of candidate models that is too large to have a uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true losses. While the common approach to such challenges is SRM (or regularization) based learning algorithms, we propose a novel learning paradigm that relies on stronger incorporation of empirical data and requires less algorithmic decisions to be based on prior assumptions. We analyze the generalization capabilities of our approach and demonstrate its merits in several common learning assumptions, including similarity of close points, clustering of the domain into highly label-homogeneous regions, Lipschitzness assumptions of the labeling rule, and contrastive learning assumptions. Our approach allows utilizing such assumptions without the need to know their true parameters a priori.

## 282. FinNuE: Exposing the Risks of Using BERTScore for Numerical Semantic Evaluation in Finance

**作者**: Yu-Shiang Huang, Yun-Yu Lee, Tzu-Hsin Chou, Che Lin, Chuan-Ju Wang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09997v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09997v1)

**摘要**:

BERTScore has become a widely adopted metric for evaluating semantic similarity between natural language sentences. However, we identify a critical limitation: BERTScore exhibits low sensitivity to numerical variation, a significant weakness in finance where numerical precision directly affects meaning (e.g., distinguishing a 2% gain from a 20% loss). We introduce FinNuE, a diagnostic dataset constructed with controlled numerical perturbations across earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles. Using FinNuE, demonstrate that BERTScore fails to distinguish semantically critical numerical differences, often assigning high similarity scores to financially divergent text pairs. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations of embedding-based metrics for finance and motivate numerically-aware evaluation frameworks for financial NLP.

**作者**: Hui Dou, Lei Jin, Yuxuan Zhou, Jiang He, Yiwen Zhang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09998v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09998v1)

**摘要**:

The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs. Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.

## 284. MOBA: A Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack against LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection Systems

**作者**: Saket S. Chaturvedi, Gaurav Bagwe, Lan Zhang, Pan He, Xiaoyong Yuan

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.09999v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09999v1)

**摘要**:

LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%. Our work reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the urgent need for defenses that account for material-level properties in real-world environments.

**作者**: Shivam Sharma, Riya Naik, Tejas Gawas, Heramb Patil, Kunal Korgaonkar

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10002v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10002v1)

**摘要**:

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

## 286. DBGroup: Dual-Branch Point Grouping for Weakly Supervised 3D Instance Segmentation

**作者**: Xuexun Liu, Xiaoxu Xu, Qiudan Zhang, Lin Ma, Xu Wang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10003v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10003v1)

**摘要**:

Weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation is essential for 3D scene understanding, especially as the growing scale of data and high annotation costs associated with fully supervised approaches. Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

## 287. LampQ: Towards Accurate Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers

**作者**: Minjun Kim, Jaeri Lee, Jongjin Kim, Jeongin Yun, Yongmo Kwon, U Kang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10004v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10004v1)

**摘要**:

How can we accurately quantize a pre-trained Vision Transformer model? Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively. Extensive experiments show that LampQ provides the state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10006v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10006v1)

**摘要**:

Rotatable intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) introduces a new spatial degree of freedom (DoF) by dynamically adjusting orientations without the need of changing its elements' positions in real time. To unleash the full potential of rotatable IRSs for wireless communications, this paper investigates the joint optimization of IRS rotation angles to maximize the minimum expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all locations within a given target area. We first propose an angle-dependent channel model that accurately characterizes the reception and reflection of each IRS element. Different from the conventional cosine-law assumption, the proposed model captures the practical electromagnetic characteristics of the IRS, including the effective reception area and reflection efficiency. For the single target location case, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is developed to solve the SNR maximization problem, and a closed-form expression for a near-optimal solution is derived to provide useful insights. For the general area coverage enhancement case, the optimal rotation is obtained through a two-loop PSO-based iterative algorithm with null-point detection. In this algorithm, the outer loop updates the global rotation angles to maximize the minimum SNR over the target area, whereas the inner loop evaluates the SNR distribution within the area to identify the location corresponding to the minimum SNR through null-point detection. Numerical results demonstrate significant SNR improvement achieved by the proposed rotatable IRS design over various benchmark schemes under different system setups.

**arXiv**: [2511.10008v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10008v1)

**摘要**:

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models revolutionize robotic systems by enabling end-to-end perception-to-action pipelines that integrate multiple sensory modalities, such as visual signals processed by cameras and auditory signals captured by microphones. This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored.
  To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel ``Real-Sim-Real'' framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AR]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10010v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10010v1)

**摘要**:

The remarkable progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is foundation-ally linked to a concurrent revolution in computer architecture. As AI models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have grown in complexity, their massive computational demands have pushed traditional architectures to their limits. This paper provides a structured review of this co-evolution, analyzing the architectural landscape designed to accelerate modern AI workloads. We explore the dominant architectural paradigms Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Appli-cation-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field-Programmable Gate Ar-rays (FPGAs) by breaking down their design philosophies, key features, and per-formance trade-offs. The core principles essential for performance and energy efficiency, including dataflow optimization, advanced memory hierarchies, spar-sity, and quantization, are analyzed. Furthermore, this paper looks ahead to emerging technologies such as Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and neuromorphic computing, which may redefine future computation. By synthesizing architec-tural principles with quantitative performance data from industry-standard benchmarks, this survey presents a comprehensive picture of the AI accelerator landscape. We conclude that AI and computer architecture are in a symbiotic relationship, where hardware-software co-design is no longer an optimization but a necessity for future progress in computing.

**arXiv**: [2511.10013v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10013v1)

**摘要**:

Automated interpretation of medical images demands robust modeling of complex visual-semantic relationships while addressing annotation scarcity, label imbalance, and clinical plausibility constraints. We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles. To address annotation scarcity, we also introduce TongueAtlas-4K, a comprehensive expert-curated benchmark comprising 4,000 images annotated with 22 diagnostic labels--representing the largest public dataset in tongue analysis. Validation shows our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. While optimized for tongue diagnosis, the framework readily generalizes to broader diagnostic medical imaging tasks.

**作者**: Guofeng Meng, Li Shen, Qiuyan Zhong, Wei Wang, Haizhou Zhang, Xiaozhen Wang

**期刊**: arXiv [q-bio.QM]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10014v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10014v1)

**摘要**:

Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming various domains, including biomedicine and healthcare, and demonstrate remarkable potential from scientific research to new drug discovery. Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, as a useful application of LLMs, can improve contextual reasoning through structured entity and relationship identification from long-context knowledge, e.g. biomedical literature. Even though many advantages over naive RAGs, most of graph-based RAGs are computationally intensive, which limits their application to large-scale dataset. To address this issue, we introduce fastbmRAG, an fast graph-based RAG optimized for biomedical literature. Utilizing well organized structure of biomedical papers, fastbmRAG divides the construction of knowledge graph into two stages, first drafting graphs using abstracts; and second, refining them using main texts guided by vector-based entity linking, which minimizes redundancy and computational load. Our evaluations demonstrate that fastbmRAG is over 10x faster than existing graph-RAG tools and achieve superior coverage and accuracy to input knowledge. FastbmRAG provides a fast solution for quickly understanding, summarizing, and answering questions about biomedical literature on a large scale. FastbmRAG is public available in https://github.com/menggf/fastbmRAG.

## 293. AffordBot: 3D Fine-grained Embodied Reasoning via Multimodal Large Language Models

**作者**: Xinyi Wang, Xun Yang, Yanlong Xu, Yuchen Wu, Zhen Li, Na Zhao

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10017v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10017v1)

**摘要**:

Effective human-agent collaboration in physical environments requires understanding not only what to act upon, but also where the actionable elements are and how to interact with them. Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.

## 294. Interaction as Interference: A Quantum-Inspired Aggregation Approach

**作者**: Pilsung Kang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10018v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10018v1)

**摘要**:

Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(Δ_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism.
  We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences. Holding learned parameters fixed, toggling aggregation from incoherent to coherent consistently improves negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error, with positive Coherent Gain on both datasets.

## 295. Anomagic: Crossmodal Prompt-driven Zero-shot Anomaly Generation

**作者**: Yuxin Jiang, Wei Luo, Hui Zhang, Qiyu Chen, Haiming Yao, Weiming Shen, Yunkang Cao

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10020v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10020v1)

**摘要**:

We propose Anomagic, a zero-shot anomaly generation method that produces semantically coherent anomalies without requiring any exemplar anomalies. By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.

## 296. GraphSB: Boosting Imbalanced Node Classification on Graphs through Structural Balance

**作者**: Chaofan Zhu, Xiaobing Rui, Zhixiao Wang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10022v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10022v1)

**摘要**:

Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\%.

**作者**: Noam Koren, Ralf J. J. Mackenbach, Ruud J. G. van Sloun, Kira Radinsky, Daniel Freedman

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10025v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10025v1)

**摘要**:

Neural operators have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning solution operators of partial differential equa- tions (PDEs) directly from data. Existing methods, such as those based on Fourier or graph techniques, make strong as- sumptions about the structure of the kernel integral opera- tor, assumptions which may limit expressivity. We present SVD-NO, a neural operator that explicitly parameterizes the kernel by its singular-value decomposition (SVD) and then carries out the integral directly in the low-rank basis. Two lightweight networks learn the left and right singular func- tions, a diagonal parameter matrix learns the singular values, and a Gram-matrix regularizer enforces orthonormality. As SVD-NO approximates the full kernel, it obtains a high de- gree of expressivity. Furthermore, due to its low-rank struc- ture the computational complexity of applying the operator remains reasonable, leading to a practical system. In exten- sive evaluations on five diverse benchmark equations, SVD- NO achieves a new state of the art. In particular, SVD-NO provides greater performance gains on PDEs whose solutions are highly spatially variable. The code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/2noamk/SVDNO.git.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10027v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10027v1)

**摘要**:

Emergency responders managing hazardous material HAZMAT incidents face critical, time-sensitive decisions, manually navigating extensive chemical guidelines. We investigate whether today's language models can assist responders by rapidly and reliably understanding critical information, identifying hazards, and providing recommendations.We introduce the Chemical Emergency Response Evaluation Framework (ChEmREF), a new benchmark comprising questions on 1,035 HAZMAT chemicals from the Emergency Response Guidebook and the PubChem Database. ChEmREF is organized into three tasks: (1) translation of chemical representation between structured and unstructured forms (e.g., converting C2H6O to ethanol), (2) emergency response generation (e.g., recommending appropriate evacuation distances) and (3) domain knowledge question answering from chemical safety and certification exams. Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.

## 300. ScaleFormer: Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer

**作者**: Jiangshu Du, Wenpeng Yin, Philip Yu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10029v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10029v1)

**摘要**:

The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention severely limits the application of Transformer-based models to long-context tasks. While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text. Experiments on long-document summarization show that our method is highly competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring architectural modifications or external retrieval mechanisms.

## 301. Multi-agent In-context Coordination via Decentralized Memory Retrieval

**作者**: Tao Jiang, Zichuan Lin, Lihe Li, Yi-Chen Li, Cong Guan, Lei Yuan, Zongzhang Zhang, Yang Yu, Deheng Ye

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.MA]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10030v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10030v1)

**摘要**:

Large transformer models, trained on diverse datasets, have demonstrated impressive few-shot performance on previously unseen tasks without requiring parameter updates. This capability has also been explored in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents interact with the environment to retrieve context and maximize cumulative rewards, showcasing strong adaptability in complex settings. However, in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents must coordinate toward a shared goal, decentralized policy deployment can lead to mismatches in task alignment and reward assignment, limiting the efficiency of policy adaptation. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-agent In-context Coordination via Decentralized Memory Retrieval (MAICC), a novel approach designed to enhance coordination by fast adaptation. Our method involves training a centralized embedding model to capture fine-grained trajectory representations, followed by decentralized models that approximate the centralized one to obtain team-level task information. Based on the learned embeddings, relevant trajectories are retrieved as context, which, combined with the agents' current sub-trajectories, inform decision-making. During decentralized execution, we introduce a novel memory mechanism that effectively balances test-time online data with offline memory. Based on the constructed memory, we propose a hybrid utility score that incorporates both individual- and team-level returns, ensuring credit assignment across agents. Extensive experiments on cooperative MARL benchmarks, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF) and SMAC (v1/v2), show that MAICC enables faster adaptation to unseen tasks compared to existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/LAMDA-RL/MAICC.

## 302. Temporal Latent Variable Structural Causal Model for Causal Discovery under External Interferences

**作者**: Ruichu Cai, Xiaokai Huang, Wei Chen, Zijian Li, Zhifeng Hao

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**DOI**: [10.1016/j.neucom.2025.130281](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2025.130281)

**摘要**:

Inferring causal relationships from observed data is an important task, yet it becomes challenging when the data is subject to various external interferences. Most of these interferences are the additional effects of external factors on observed variables. Since these external factors are often unknown, we introduce latent variables to represent these unobserved factors that affect the observed data. Specifically, to capture the causal strength and adjacency information, we propose a new temporal latent variable structural causal model, incorporating causal strength and adjacency coefficients that represent the causal relationships between variables. Considering that expert knowledge can provide information about unknown interferences in certain scenarios, we develop a method that facilitates the incorporation of prior knowledge into parameter learning based on Variational Inference, to guide the model estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our proposed method.

## 303. Moral Change or Noise? On Problems of Aligning AI With Temporally Unstable Human Feedback

**arXiv**: [2511.10032v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10032v1)

**摘要**:

Alignment methods in moral domains seek to elicit moral preferences of human stakeholders and incorporate them into AI. This presupposes moral preferences as static targets, but such preferences often evolve over time. Proper alignment of AI to dynamic human preferences should ideally account for "legitimate" changes to moral reasoning, while ignoring changes related to attention deficits, cognitive biases, or other arbitrary factors. However, common AI alignment approaches largely neglect temporal changes in preferences, posing serious challenges to proper alignment, especially in high-stakes applications of AI, e.g., in healthcare domains, where misalignment can jeopardize the trustworthiness of the system and yield serious individual and societal harms. This work investigates the extent to which people's moral preferences change over time, and the impact of such changes on AI alignment. Our study is grounded in the kidney allocation domain, where we elicit responses to pairwise comparisons of hypothetical kidney transplant patients from over 400 participants across 3-5 sessions. We find that, on average, participants change their response to the same scenario presented at different times around 6-20% of the time (exhibiting "response instability"). Additionally, we observe significant shifts in several participants' retrofitted decision-making models over time (capturing "model instability"). The predictive performance of simple AI models decreases as a function of both response and model instability. Moreover, predictive performance diminishes over time, highlighting the importance of accounting for temporal changes in preferences during training. These findings raise fundamental normative and technical challenges relevant to AI alignment, highlighting the need to better understand the object of alignment (what to align to) when user preferences change significantly over time.

**arXiv**: [2511.10033v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10033v1)

**摘要**:

Transformer has emerged as a powerful deep-learning technique for two-dimensional (2D) seismic data interpolation, owing to its global modeling ability. However, its core operation introduces heavy computational burden due to the quadratic complexity, hindering its further application to higher-dimensional data. To achieve Transformer-based three-dimensional (3D) seismic interpolation, we propose a 2.5-dimensional Transformer network (T-2.5D) that adopts a cross-dimensional transfer learning (TL) strategy, so as to adapt the 2D Transformer encoders to 3D seismic data. The proposed T-2.5D is mainly composed of 2D Transformer encoders and 3D seismic dimension adapters (SDAs). Each 3D SDA is placed before a Transformer encoder to learn spatial correlation information across seismic lines. The proposed cross-dimensional TL strategy comprises two stages: 2D pre-training and 3D fine-tuning. In the first stage, we optimize the 2D Transformer encoders using a large amount of 2D data patches. In the second stage, we freeze the 2D Transformer encoders and fine-tune the 3D SDAs using limited 3D data volumes. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets are conducted to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of T-2.5D. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to that of full 3D Transformer at a significantly low cost.

**摘要**:

As a critical task in autonomous driving perception systems, 3D object detection is used to identify and track key objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians. However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\% mAP, +0.8\% NDS, and +1.3\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.

**arXiv**: [2511.10037v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10037v1)

**摘要**:

Existing tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges when processing complex queries. Current frameworks such as ReAct are prone to local optimization traps due to their reliance on incremental decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm that fundamentally resolves local optimization bottlenecks through architectural innovation. Central to our approach is a novel Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning for complex queries, enabling optimized execution beyond conventional tool coordination. We also introduce ComplexTool-Plan, a large-scale benchmark dataset featuring complex queries that demand sophisticated multi-tool composition and coordination capabilities. Additionally, we develop a two-stage training methodology that integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), systematically enhancing the Planner's tool selection accuracy and global planning awareness through structured DAG-based planning. When integrated with a capable executor, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the StableToolBench benchmark for complex user queries, demonstrating superior end-to-end execution capabilities and robust handling of intricate multi-tool workflows.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10038v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10038v1)

**摘要**:

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emerging reasoning capabilities, current inference-time expansion methods incur prohibitive computational costs by exhaustive sampling. Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10040v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10040v1)

**摘要**:

Generating high-fidelity 3D contents remains a fundamental challenge due to the complexity of representing arbitrary topologies-such as open surfaces and intricate internal structures-while preserving geometric details. Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, yielding superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility.

## 309. Do Language Models Associate Sound with Meaning? A Multimodal Study of Sound Symbolism

**作者**: Jinhong Jeong, Sunghyun Lee, Jaeyoung Lee, Seonah Han, Youngjae Yu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10045v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10045v1)

**摘要**:

Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.

**arXiv**: [2511.10046v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10046v1)

**摘要**:

Visible-infrared object detection has gained sufficient attention due to its detection performance in low light, fog, and rain conditions. However, visible and infrared modalities captured by different sensors exist the information imbalance problem in complex scenarios, which can cause inadequate cross-modal fusion, resulting in degraded detection performance. \textcolor{red}{Furthermore, most existing methods use transformers in the spatial domain to capture complementary features, ignoring the advantages of developing frequency domain transformers to mine complementary information.} To solve these weaknesses, we propose a frequency domain fusion transformer, called FreDFT, for visible-infrared object detection. The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner. Moreover, a local feature enhancement module (LFEM) is developed to strengthen multimodal local feature representation and promote multimodal feature fusion by using various convolution layers and applying a channel shuffle. Extensive experimental results have verified that our proposed FreDFT achieves excellent performance on multiple public datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

## 311. MuSc-V2: Zero-Shot Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Classification and Segmentation with Mutual Scoring of Unlabeled Samples

**作者**: Xurui Li, Feng Xue, Yu Zhou

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10047v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10047v1)

**摘要**:

Zero-shot anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) methods aim to identify and outline defects without using any labeled samples. In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\textbf{+23.7\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\textbf{+19.3\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods. The code will be available at The code will be available at \href{https://github.com/HUST-SLOW/MuSc-V2}{https://github.com/HUST-SLOW/MuSc-V2}.

**作者**: Yanjiao Yang, Daniel Suen, Yen-Chi Chen

**期刊**: arXiv [stat.ME]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10048v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10048v1)

**摘要**:

The masking-one-out (MOO) procedure, masking an observed entry and comparing it versus its imputed values, is a very common procedure for comparing imputation models. We study the optimum of this procedure and generalize it to a missing data assumption and establish the corresponding semi-parametric efficiency theory. However, MOO is a measure of prediction accuracy, which is not ideal for evaluating an imputation model. To address this issue, we introduce three modified MOO criteria, based on rank transformation, energy distance, and likelihood principle, that allow us to select an imputation model that properly account for the stochastic nature of data. The likelihood approach further enables an elegant framework of learning an imputation model from the data and we derive its statistical and computational learning theories as well as consistency of BIC model selection. We also show how MOO is related to the missing-at-random assumption. Finally, we introduce the prediction-imputation diagram, a two-dimensional diagram visually comparing both the prediction and imputation utilities for various imputation models.

**arXiv**: [2511.10050v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10050v1)

**摘要**:

Traffic sign recognition plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient transportation of autonomous vehicles but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks using stickers or laser projections. While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.

## 314. GraphIF: Enhancing Multi-Turn Instruction Following for Large Language Models with Relation Graph Prompt

**作者**: Zhenhe Li, Can Lin, Ling Zheng, Wen-Da Wei, Junli Liang, Qi Song

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10051v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10051v1)

**摘要**:

Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.

**作者**: Yun Wang, Lingyun Yang, Senhao Yu, Yixiao Wang, Ruixing Li, Zhixiang Wei, James Yen, Zhengwei Qi

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10054v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10054v1)

**摘要**:

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale language models by activating only a subset of specialized expert networks for each input token, thereby reducing the number of floating-point operations. However, the growing size of modern MoE models causes their full parameter sets to exceed GPU memory capacity; for example, Mixtral-8x7B has 45 billion parameters and requires 87 GB of memory even though only 14 billion parameters are used per token. Existing systems alleviate this limitation by offloading inactive experts to CPU memory, but transferring experts across the PCIe interconnect incurs significant latency (about 10 ms). Prefetching heuristics aim to hide this latency by predicting which experts are needed, but prefetch failures introduce significant stalls and amplify inference latency. In the event of a prefetch failure, prior work offers two primary solutions: either fetch the expert on demand, which incurs a long stall due to the PCIe bottleneck, or drop the expert from the computation, which significantly degrades model accuracy. The critical challenge, therefore, is to maintain both high inference speed and model accuracy when prefetching fails.

## 316. Image Aesthetic Reasoning via HCM-GRPO: Empowering Compact Model for Superior Performance

**作者**: Zhiyuan Hu, Zheng Sun, Yi Wei, Long Yu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10055v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10055v1)

**摘要**:

The performance of image generation has been significantly improved in recent years. However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.

## 317. From Static Structures to Ensembles: Studying and Harnessing Protein Structure Tokenization

**作者**: Zijing Liu, Bin Feng, He Cao, Yu Li

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10056v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10056v1)

**摘要**:

Protein structure tokenization converts 3D structures into discrete or vectorized representations, enabling the integration of structural and sequence data. Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural "language". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as "structural synonyms". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple "synonym swap" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms. This computationally lightweight method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility, performing competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our study provides fundamental insights into the nature of discrete protein structure representations and introduces a powerful, near-instantaneous method for modeling protein dynamics.

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10059v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10059v1)

**摘要**:

Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) discern confused objects that are visually present but audio-absent? To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

## 319. Multivariate Gaussian Representation Learning for Medical Action Evaluation

**作者**: Luming Yang, Haoxian Liu, Siqing Li, Alper Yilmaz

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10060v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10060v1)

**摘要**:

Fine-grained action evaluation in medical vision faces unique challenges due to the unavailability of comprehensive datasets, stringent precision requirements, and insufficient spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of very rapid actions. To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10062v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10062v1)

**摘要**:

Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs), which combine parameterized quantum circuits with classical neural layers, are emerging as promising models in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. While quantum circuits are not naturally measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), most HQNNs (in NISQ era) are still trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly dictate runtime and scalability. Hence, FLOPs represent a practical and viable metric to measure the computational complexity of HQNNs. In this work, we introduce FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework that formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and FLOPs. Unlike traditional approaches, FAQNAS explicitly incorporates FLOPs into the optimization objective, enabling the discovery of architectures that achieve strong performance while minimizing computational cost. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Iris) show that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements, while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed. Pareto-optimal solutions reveal that competitive accuracy can often be achieved with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines. Our results establish FLOPs-awareness as a practical criterion for HQNN design in the NISQ era and as a scalable principle for future HQNN systems.

## 321. Radiology Workflow-Guided Hierarchical Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Medical Report Generation

**作者**: Bodong Du, Honglong Yang, Xiaomeng Li

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10065v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10065v1)

**摘要**:

Radiologists compose diagnostic reports through a structured workflow: they describe visual findings, summarize them into impressions, and carefully refine statements in clinically critical cases. However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

## 322. Enhancing the Medical Context-Awareness Ability of LLMs via Multifaceted Self-Refinement Learning

**作者**: Yuxuan Zhou, Yubin Wang, Bin Wang, Chen Ning, Xien Liu, Ji Wu, Jianye Hao

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10067v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10067v1)

**摘要**:

Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

**摘要**:

Confidence alone is often misleading in hyperspectral image classification, as models tend to mistake high predictive scores for correctness while lacking awareness of uncertainty. This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that a wide range of state-of-the-art methods benefit from the integration of CABIN, with improved labeling efficiency and performance.

**DOI**: [10.21437/Interspeech.2025-884](https://doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2025-884)

**摘要**:

We present ADI-20, an extension of the previously published ADI-17 Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) dataset. ADI-20 covers all Arabic-speaking countries' dialects. It comprises 3,556 hours from 19 Arabic dialects in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We used this dataset to train and evaluate various state-of-the-art ADI systems. We explored fine-tuning pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN-based models, as well as Whisper encoder blocks coupled with an attention pooling layer and a classification dense layer. We investigated the effect of (i) training data size and (ii) the model's number of parameters on identification performance. Our results show a small decrease in F1 score while using only 30% of the original training data. We open-source our collected data and trained models to enable the reproduction of our work, as well as support further research in ADI.

## 325. Tree-Based Stochastic Optimization for Solving Large-Scale Urban Network Security Games

**作者**: Shuxin Zhuang, Linjian Meng, Shuxin Li, Minming Li, Youzhi Zhang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**arXiv**: [2511.10072v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10072v1)

**摘要**:

Urban Network Security Games (UNSGs), which model the strategic allocation of limited security resources on city road networks, are critical for urban safety. However, finding a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in large-scale UNSGs is challenging due to their massive and combinatorial action spaces. One common approach to addressing these games is the Policy-Space Response Oracle (PSRO) framework, which requires computing best responses (BR) at each iteration. However, precisely computing exact BRs is impractical in large-scale games, and employing reinforcement learning to approximate BRs inevitably introduces errors, which limits the overall effectiveness of the PSRO methods. Recent advancements in leveraging non-convex stochastic optimization to approximate an NE offer a promising alternative to the burdensome BR computation. However, utilizing existing stochastic optimization techniques with an unbiased loss function for UNSGs remains challenging because the action spaces are too vast to be effectively represented by neural networks. To address these issues, we introduce Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO), a framework that bridges the gap between the stochastic optimization paradigm for NE-finding and the demands of UNSGs. Specifically, we employ the tree-based action representation that maps the whole action space onto a tree structure, addressing the challenge faced by neural networks in representing actions when the action space cannot be enumerated. We then incorporate this representation into the loss function and theoretically demonstrate its equivalence to the unbiased loss function. To further enhance the quality of the converged solution, we introduce a sample-and-prune mechanism that reduces the risk of being trapped in suboptimal local optima. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of TSO over other baseline algorithms in addressing the UNSGs.

## 326. Bridging the Initialization Gap: A Co-Optimization Framework for Mixed-Size Global Placement

**作者**: Yuhao Ren, Yiting Liu, Yanfei Zhou, Zhiyu Zheng, Li Shang, Fan Yang, Zhiang Wang

**期刊**: arXiv [eess.SP]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10073v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10073v1)

**摘要**:

Global placement is a critical step with high computational complexity in VLSI physical design. Modern analytical placers formulate the placement problem as a nonlinear optimization, where initialization strongly affects both convergence behavior and final placement quality. However, existing initialization methods exhibit a trade-off: area-aware initializers account for cell areas but are computationally expensive and can dominate total runtime, while fast point-based initializers ignore cell area, leading to a modeling gap that impairs convergence and solution quality. We propose a lightweight co-optimization framework that bridges this initialization gap through two strategies. First, an area-hint refinement initializer incorporates heuristic cell area information into a signed graph signal by augmenting the netlist graph with virtual nodes and negative-weight edges, yielding an area-aware and spectrally smooth placement initialization. Second, a macro-schedule placement procedure progressively restores area constraints, enabling a smooth transition from the refined initializer to the full area-aware objective and producing high-quality placement results. We evaluate the framework on macro-heavy ISPD2005 academic benchmarks and two real-world industrial designs across two technology nodes (12 cases in total). Experimental results show that our method consistently improves half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) over point-based initializers in 11 out of 12 cases, achieving up to 2.2% HPWL reduction, while running approximately 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art area-aware initializer.

## 327. VLF-MSC: Vision-Language Feature-Based Multimodal Semantic Communication System

**作者**: Gwangyeon Ahn, Jiwan Seo, Joonhyuk Kang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10074v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10074v1)

**摘要**:

We propose Vision-Language Feature-based Multimodal Semantic Communication (VLF-MSC), a unified system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver. Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

## 328. Format Matters: The Robustness of Multimodal LLMs in Reviewing Evidence from Tables and Charts

**arXiv**: [2511.10075v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10075v1)

**摘要**:

With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.

## 329. Mitigating Error Accumulation in Co-Speech Motion Generation via Global Rotation Diffusion and Multi-Level Constraints

**作者**: Xiangyue Zhang, Jianfang Li, Jianqiang Ren, Jiaxu Zhang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10076v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10076v1)

**摘要**:

Reliable co-speech motion generation requires precise motion representation and consistent structural priors across all joints. Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.

## 330. Physics-informed Machine Learning for Static Friction Modeling in Robotic Manipulators Based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

**作者**: Yizheng Wang, Timon Rabczuk, Yinghua Liu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.RO]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10079v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10079v1)

**摘要**:

Friction modeling plays a crucial role in achieving high-precision motion control in robotic operating systems. Traditional static friction models (such as the Stribeck model) are widely used due to their simple forms; however, they typically require predefined functional assumptions, which poses significant challenges when dealing with unknown functional structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a physics-inspired machine learning approach based on the Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) for static friction modeling of robotic joints. The method integrates spline activation functions with a symbolic regression mechanism, enabling model simplification and physical expression extraction through pruning and attribute scoring, while maintaining both high prediction accuracy and interpretability. We first validate the method's capability to accurately identify key parameters under known functional models, and further demonstrate its robustness and generalization ability under conditions with unknown functional structures and noisy data. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real friction data collected from a six-degree-of-freedom industrial manipulator show that the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination greater than 0.95 across various tasks and successfully extracts concise and physically meaningful friction expressions. This study provides a new perspective for interpretable and data-driven robotic friction modeling with promising engineering applicability.

## 331. GridPrune: From "Where to Look" to "What to Select" in Visual Token Pruning for MLLMs

**作者**: Yuxiang Duan, Ao Li, Yingqin Li, Luyu Li, Pengwei Wang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10081v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10081v1)

**摘要**:

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to ("where to look") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail ("what to select"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing "what to select", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider "where to look", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.

**arXiv**: [2511.10087v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10087v1)

**摘要**:

Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (O2O-RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for safe and efficient robotic policy deployment but suffers from two fundamental challenges: limited coverage of multimodal behaviors and distributional shifts during online adaptation. We propose UEPO, a unified generative framework inspired by large language model pretraining and fine-tuning strategies. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a multi-seed dynamics-aware diffusion policy that efficiently captures diverse modalities without training multiple models; (2) a dynamic divergence regularization mechanism that enforces physically meaningful policy diversity; and (3) a diffusion-based data augmentation module that enhances dynamics model generalization. On the D4RL benchmark, UEPO achieves +5.9\% absolute improvement over Uni-O4 on locomotion tasks and +12.4\% on dexterous manipulation, demonstrating strong generalization and scalability.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10088v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10088v1)

**摘要**:

Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10089v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10089v1)

**摘要**:

Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are largely used in AI-powered real-world applications and value creation. However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.

**摘要**:

This paper describes Elyadata \& LIA's joint submission to the NADI multi-dialectal Arabic Speech Processing 2025. We participated in the Spoken Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) and multi-dialectal Arabic ASR subtasks. Our submission ranked first for the ADI subtask and second for the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR subtask among all participants. Our ADI system is a fine-tuned Whisper-large-v3 encoder with data augmentation. This system obtained the highest ADI accuracy score of \textbf{79.83\%} on the official test set. For multi-dialectal Arabic ASR, we fine-tuned SeamlessM4T-v2 Large (Egyptian variant) separately for each of the eight considered dialects. Overall, we obtained an average WER and CER of \textbf{38.54\%} and \textbf{14.53\%}, respectively, on the test set. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of large pre-trained speech models with targeted fine-tuning for Arabic speech processing.

**arXiv**: [2511.10091v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10091v1)

**摘要**:

Large Language Models (LLMs) hold rich implicit knowledge and powerful transferability. In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR. Moreover, experiments on zero-shot scenarios show that SUGAR is more versatile than linear-based methods.

**DOI**: [10.14339/STO-MP-IST-209-6759-PDF](https://doi.org/10.14339/STO-MP-IST-209-6759-PDF)

**摘要**:

In this paper, military use cases or applications and implementation thereof are considered for natural language processing and large language models, which have broken into fame with the invention of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) and the extensive foundation model pretraining done by OpenAI for ChatGPT and others. First, we interrogate a GPT-based language model (viz. Microsoft Copilot) to make it reveal its own knowledge about their potential military applications and then critically assess the information. Second, we study how commercial cloud services (viz. Microsoft Azure) could be used readily to build such applications and assess which of them are feasible. We conclude that the summarization and generative properties of language models directly facilitate many applications at large and other features may find particular uses.

**作者**: Yiming Tang, Abhijeet Sinha, Dianbo Liu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10094v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10094v1)

**摘要**:

Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

## 339. MTAttack: Multi-Target Backdoor Attacks against Large Vision-Language Models

**作者**: Zihan Wang, Guansong Pang, Wenjun Miao, Jin Zheng, Xiao Bai

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10098v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10098v1)

**摘要**:

Recent advances in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various vision-language tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining and instruction tuning. However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

## 340. Balancing Centralized Learning and Distributed Self-Organization: A Hybrid Model for Embodied Morphogenesis

**作者**: Takehiro Ishikawa

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10101v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10101v1)

**摘要**:

We investigate how to couple a learnable brain-like'' controller to a cell-like'' Gray--Scott substrate to steer pattern formation with minimal effort. A compact convolutional policy is embedded in a differentiable PyTorch reaction--diffusion simulator, producing spatially smooth, bounded modulations of the feed and kill parameters ($ΔF$, $ΔK$) under a warm--hold--decay gain schedule. Training optimizes Turing-band spectral targets (FFT-based) while penalizing control effort ($\ell_1/\ell_2$) and instability. We compare three regimes: pure reaction--diffusion, NN-dominant, and a hybrid coupling. The hybrid achieves reliable, fast formation of target textures: 100% strict convergence in $\sim 165$ steps, matching cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs.\ 0.434) while using $\sim 15\times$ less $\ell_1$ effort and $>200\times$ less $\ell_2$ power than NN-dominant control. An amplitude sweep reveals a non-monotonic Goldilocks'' zone ($A \approx 0.03$--$0.045$) that yields 100\% quasi convergence in 94--96 steps, whereas weaker or stronger gains fail to converge or degrade selectivity. These results quantify morphological computation: the controller seeds then cedes,'' providing brief, sparse nudges that place the system in the correct basin of attraction, after which local physics maintains the pattern. The study offers a practical recipe for building steerable, robust, and energy-efficient embodied systems that exploit an optimal division of labor between centralized learning and distributed self-organization.

**作者**: Jueun Ko, Hyewon Park, Hyesong Choi, Dongbo Min

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10107v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10107v1)

**摘要**:

Stereo Depth Estimation in real-world environments poses significant challenges due to dynamic domain shifts, sparse or unreliable supervision, and the high cost of acquiring dense ground-truth labels. While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobIA achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

**摘要**:

The discovery of advanced metallic alloys is hindered by vast composition spaces, competing property objectives, and real-world constraints on manufacturability. Here we introduce MATAI, a generalist machine learning framework for property prediction and inverse design of as-cast alloys. MATAI integrates a curated alloy database, deep neural network-based property predictors, a constraint-aware optimization engine, and an iterative AI-experiment feedback loop. The framework estimates key mechanical propertie, sincluding density, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation, directly from composition, using multi-task learning and physics-informed inductive biases. Alloy design is framed as a constrained optimization problem and solved using a bi-level approach that combines local search with symbolic constraint programming. We demonstrate MATAI's capabilities on the Ti-based alloy system, a canonical class of lightweight structural materials, where it rapidly identifies candidates that simultaneously achieve lower density (<4.45 g/cm3), higher strength (>1000 MPa) and appreciable ductility (>5%) through only seven iterations. Experimental validation confirms that MATAI-designed alloys outperform commercial references such as TC4, highlighting the framework's potential to accelerate the discovery of lightweight, high-performance materials under real-world design constraints.

## 343. Intilligence Foundation Model: A New Perspective to Approach Artificial General Intelligence

**作者**: Borui Cai, Yao Zhao

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10119v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10119v1)

**摘要**:

We propose a new perspective for approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) through an intelligence foundation model (IFM). Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.

**作者**: Philipp Seeberger, Steffen Freisinger, Tobias Bocklet, Korbinian Riedhammer

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10120v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10120v1)

**摘要**:

Due to the rapid growth of social media platforms, these tools have become essential for monitoring information during ongoing disaster events. However, extracting valuable insights requires real-time processing of vast amounts of data. A major challenge in existing systems is their exposure to event-related biases, which negatively affects their ability to generalize to emerging events. While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events. Our approach outperforms multiple baselines by up to +1.9% F1 and significantly improves a PLM-based classifier across three disaster classification tasks.

## 345. RAGFort: Dual-Path Defense Against Proprietary Knowledge Base Extraction in Retrieval-Augmented Generation

**作者**: Qinfeng Li, Miao Pan, Ke Xiong, Ge Su, Zhiqiang Shen, Yan Liu, Bing Sun, Hao Peng, Xuhong Zhang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10128v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10128v1)

**摘要**:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed over proprietary knowledge bases face growing threats from reconstruction attacks that aggregate model responses to replicate knowledge bases. Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining "contrastive reindexing" for inter-class isolation and "constrained cascade generation" for intra-class protection. Experiments across security, performance, and robustness confirm that RAGFort significantly reduces reconstruction success while preserving answer quality, offering comprehensive defense against knowledge base extraction attacks.

## 346. RI-Loss: A Learnable Residual-Informed Loss for Time Series Forecasting

**作者**: Jieting Wang, Xiaolei Shang, Feijiang Li, Furong Peng

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10130v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10130v1)

**摘要**:

Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

## 347. Explicit Temporal-Semantic Modeling for Dense Video Captioning via Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction

**作者**: Mingda Jia, Weiliang Meng, Zenghuang Fu, Yiheng Li, Qi Zeng, Yifan Zhang, Ju Xin, Rongtao Xu, Jiguang Zhang, Xiaopeng Zhang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10134v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10134v1)

**摘要**:

Dense video captioning jointly localizes and captions salient events in untrimmed videos. Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.

## 348. Right Looks, Wrong Reasons: Compositional Fidelity in Text-to-Image Generation

**作者**: Mayank Vatsa, Aparna Bharati, Richa Singh

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10136v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10136v1)

**摘要**:

The architectural blueprint of today's leading text-to-image models contains a fundamental flaw: an inability to handle logical composition. This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap. Achieving genuine compositionality, we conclude, will require fundamental advances in representation and reasoning rather than incremental adjustments to existing architectures.

## 349. Split-Layer: Enhancing Implicit Neural Representation by Maximizing the Dimensionality of Feature Space

**作者**: Zhicheng Cai, Hao Zhu, Linsen Chen, Qiu Shen, Xun Cao

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10142v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10142v1)

**摘要**:

Implicit neural representation (INR) models signals as continuous functions using neural networks, offering efficient and differentiable optimization for inverse problems across diverse disciplines. However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.

## 350. UCPO: A Universal Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Method via Preference Optimization

**作者**: Zhanhong Fang, Debing Wang, Jinbiao Chen, Jiahai Wang, Zizhen Zhang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.NE]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10148v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10148v1)

**摘要**:

Neural solvers have demonstrated remarkable success in combinatorial optimization, often surpassing traditional heuristics in speed, solution quality, and generalization. However, their efficacy deteriorates significantly when confronted with complex constraints that cannot be effectively managed through simple masking mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce Universal Constrained Preference Optimization (UCPO), a novel plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates preference learning into existing neural solvers via a specially designed loss function, without requiring architectural modifications. UCPO embeds constraint satisfaction directly into a preference-based objective, eliminating the need for meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Leveraging a lightweight warm-start fine-tuning protocol, UCPO enables pre-trained models to consistently produce near-optimal, feasible solutions on challenging constraint-laden tasks, achieving exceptional performance with as little as 1\% of the original training budget.

## 351. Decoupling Bias, Aligning Distributions: Synergistic Fairness Optimization for Deepfake Detection

**作者**: Feng Ding, Wenhui Yi, Yunpeng Zhou, Xinan He, Hong Rao, Shu Hu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10150v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10150v1)

**摘要**:

Fairness is a core element in the trustworthy deployment of deepfake detection models, especially in the field of digital identity security. Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.

## 352. GEA: Generation-Enhanced Alignment for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval

**作者**: Hao Zou, Runqing Zhang, Xue Zhou, Jianxiao Zou

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**DOI**: [10.3233/FAIA250873](https://doi.org/10.3233/FAIA250873)

**摘要**:

Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) aims to retrieve person images based on natural language descriptions. Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method. More implementation details and extended results are available at https://github.com/sugelamyd123/Sup-for-GEA.

## 353. DenoGrad: Deep Gradient Denoising Framework for Enhancing the Performance of Interpretable AI Models

**作者**: J. Javier Alonso-Ramos, Ignacio Aguilera-Martos, Andrés Herrera-Poyatos, Francisco Herrera

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10161v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10161v1)

**摘要**:

The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.

## 354. Two Constraint Compilation Methods for Lifted Planning

**作者**: Periklis Mantenoglou, Luigi Bonassi, Enrico Scala, Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10164v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10164v1)

**摘要**:

We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.

**作者**: Yuancheng Sun, Yuxuan Ren, Zhaoming Chen, Xu Han, Kang Liu, Qiwei Ye

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10165v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10165v1)

**摘要**:

Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

## 356. Physically Interpretable Multi-Degradation Image Restoration via Deep Unfolding and Explainable Convolution

**作者**: Hu Gao, Xiaoning Lei, Xichen Xu, Depeng Dang, Lizhuang Ma

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10166v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10166v1)

**摘要**:

Although image restoration has advanced significantly, most existing methods target only a single type of degradation. In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, named InterIR, demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks.

**arXiv**: [2511.10173v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10173v1)

**摘要**:

Accurate localization of cephalometric landmarks from 2D lateral skull X-rays is vital for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment. Manual annotation is time-consuming and error-prone, whereas automated approaches often struggle with low contrast and anatomical complexity. This paper introduces CephRes-MHNet, a multi-head residual convolutional network for robust and efficient cephalometric landmark detection. The architecture integrates residual encoding, dual-attention mechanisms, and multi-head decoders to enhance contextual reasoning and anatomical precision. Trained on the Aariz Cephalometric dataset of 1,000 radiographs, CephRes-MHNet achieved a mean radial error (MRE) of 1.23 mm and a success detection rate (SDR) @ 2.0 mm of 85.5%, outperforming all evaluated models. In particular, it exceeded the strongest baseline, the attention-driven AFPF-Net (MRE = 1.25 mm, SDR @ 2.0 mm = 84.1%), while using less than 25% of its parameters. These results demonstrate that CephRes-MHNet attains state-of-the-art accuracy through architectural efficiency, providing a practical solution for real-world orthodontic analysis.

**摘要**:

We present an initial evaluation of NASA and IBM's Prithvi-EO-2.0 geospatial foundation model on shoreline delineation of small sandy islands using satellite images. We curated and labeled a dataset of 225 multispectral images of two Maldivian islands, which we publicly release, and fine-tuned both the 300M and 600M parameter versions of Prithvi on training subsets ranging from 5 to 181 images. Our experiments show that even with as few as 5 training images, the models achieve high performance (F1 of 0.94, IoU of 0.79). Our results demonstrate the strong transfer learning capability of Prithvi, underscoring the potential of such models to support coastal monitoring in data-poor regions.

**arXiv**: [2511.10178v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10178v1)

**摘要**:

This paper analyzes a NOMA-enabled dual-Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) relay network integrated with Ambient Backscatter (BS) communication. The system comprises a source, an energy-constrained relay with energy harvesting (EH) and BS capabilities, two NOMA users, and a BS node. The relay adopts a time-switching relaying (TSR) protocol to harvest energy and forward information ,while simultaneously enabling BS-based communication. Two IRS are deployed to enhance the S to R and R to (D1, D2) links under blockage conditions. Closed-form expressions for the Outage Probability (OP) and Throughput of both the main communication links and the BS-assisted secondary links are derived. Furthermore, throughput is analyzed under varying system parameters, including power allocation factors, reflection efficiency, IRS elements, and transmission rate. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results. numerical findings reveal critical trade-offs between the main and RS links. The proposed framework provides useful insights for designing reliable and energy-efficient NOMA-IRS-aided BS networks for future IoT applications.

**作者**: Yiran Zhang, Mingyang Lin, Mark Dras, Usman Naseem

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10182v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10182v1)

**摘要**:

Recent research has increasingly focused on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, as these scenarios more closely mirror real-world problem-solving. However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct "what-if" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path. By providing a unified and interactive framework, VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. The platform is open-source and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.

## 361. Improved Offline Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Metric Encoding

**作者**: Outongyi Lv, Yewei Yuan, Nana Liu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10187v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10187v1)

**摘要**:

Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.
  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.
  We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.

## 362. Towards Leveraging Sequential Structure in Animal Vocalizations

**作者**: Eklavya Sarkar, Mathew Magimai. -Doss

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10190v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10190v1)

**摘要**:

Animal vocalizations contain sequential structures that carry important communicative information, yet most computational bioacoustics studies average the extracted frame-level features across the temporal axis, discarding the order of the sub-units within a vocalization. This paper investigates whether discrete acoustic token sequences, derived through vector quantization and gumbel-softmax vector quantization of extracted self-supervised speech model representations can effectively capture and leverage temporal information. To that end, pairwise distance analysis of token sequences generated from HuBERT embeddings shows that they can discriminate call-types and callers across four bioacoustics datasets. Sequence classification experiments using $k$-Nearest Neighbour with Levenshtein distance show that the vector-quantized token sequences yield reasonable call-type and caller classification performances, and hold promise as alternative feature representations towards leveraging sequential information in animal vocalizations.

## 363. Text2SQL-Flow: A Robust SQL-Aware Data Augmentation Framework for Text-to-SQL

**作者**: Qifeng Cai, Hao Liang, Chang Xu, Tao Xie, Wentao Zhang, Bin Cui

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10192v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10192v1)

**摘要**:

The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

## 364. Beyond MSE: Ordinal Cross-Entropy for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting

**作者**: Jieting Wang, Huimei Shi, Feijiang Li, Xiaolei Shang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10200v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10200v1)

**摘要**:

Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.

## 365. EffiReason-Bench: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating and Advancing Efficient Reasoning in Large Language Models

**作者**: Junquan Huang, Haotian Wu, Yubo Gao, Yibo Yan, Junyan Zhang, Yonghua Hei, Song Dai, Jie Zhang, Puay Siew Tan, Xuming Hu

**arXiv**: [2511.10201v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10201v1)

**摘要**:

Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieve strong reasoning but often produce unnecessarily long explanations, increasing cost and sometimes reducing accuracy. Fair comparison of efficiency-oriented approaches is hindered by fragmented evaluation practices. We introduce EffiReason-Bench, a unified benchmark for rigorous cross-paradigm evaluation of efficient reasoning methods across three categories: Reasoning Blueprints, Dynamic Execution, and Post-hoc Refinement. To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.

## 366. VISTA: A Vision and Intent-Aware Social Attention Framework for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction

**作者**: Stephane Da Silva Martins, Emanuel Aldea, Sylvie Le Hégarat-Mascle

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10203v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10203v1)

**摘要**:

Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

## 368. Fractional neural attention for efficient multiscale sequence processing

**作者**: Cheng Kevin Qu, Andrew Ly, Pulin Gong

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10208v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10208v1)

**摘要**:

Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through Lévy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.

## 369. LiNeXt: Revisiting LiDAR Completion with Efficient Non-Diffusion Architectures

**作者**: Wenzhe He, Xiaojun Chen, Ruiqi Wang, Ruihui Li, Huilong Pi, Jiapeng Zhang, Zhuo Tang, Kenli Li

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10209v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10209v1)

**摘要**:

3D LiDAR scene completion from point clouds is a fundamental component of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff. These results demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of LiNeXt for real-time scene completion.

## 370. Advanced Black-Box Tuning of Large Language Models with Limited API Calls

**作者**: Zhikang Xie, Weilin Wan, Peizhu Gong, Weizhong Zhang, Cheng Jin

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10210v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10210v1)

**摘要**:

Black-box tuning is an emerging paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to better achieve desired behaviors, particularly when direct access to model parameters is unavailable. Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with "LogitMap Pairs" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation.

## 371. HeatV2X: Scalable Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception via Efficient Alignment and Interaction

**作者**: Yueran Zhao, Zhang Zhang, Chao Sun, Tianze Wang, Chao Yue, Nuoran Li

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10211v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10211v1)

**摘要**:

Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception extends sensing beyond single vehicle limits through transmission. However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior perception performance with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our implementation will be released soon.

## 372. Next-Frame Feature Prediction for Multimodal Deepfake Detection and Temporal Localization

**作者**: Ashutosh Anshul, Shreyas Gopal, Deepu Rajan, Eng Siong Chng

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10212v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10212v1)

**摘要**:

Recent multimodal deepfake detection methods designed for generalization conjecture that single-stage supervised training struggles to generalize across unseen manipulations and datasets. However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples. Our model, evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrates strong generalization and precise temporal localization.

## 373. Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection via Variational Domain-Invariant Learning with Test-Time Training

**作者**: Xi Yang, Han Zhang, Zhijian Lin, Yibiao Hu, Hong Han

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10213v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10213v1)

**摘要**:

Out-of-context misinformation (OOC) is a low-cost form of misinformation in news reports, which refers to place authentic images into out-of-context or fabricated image-text pairings. This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.

## 374. Persona-Aware Alignment Framework for Personalized Dialogue Generation

**作者**: Guanrong Li, Xinyu Liu, Zhen Wu, Xinyu Dai

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10215v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10215v1)

**摘要**:

Personalized dialogue generation aims to leverage persona profiles and dialogue history to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Mainstream models typically rely on token-level language model training with persona dialogue data, such as Next Token Prediction, to implicitly achieve personalization, making these methods tend to neglect the given personas and generate generic responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which directly treats persona alignment as the training objective of dialogue generation. Specifically, PAL employs a two-stage training method including Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, equipped with an easy-to-use inference strategy Select then Generate, to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses at the semantics level. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms many state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models.

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10218v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10218v1)

**摘要**:

With rapid urbanization in the modern era, traffic signals from various sensors have been playing a significant role in monitoring the states of cities, which provides a strong foundation in ensuring safe travel, reducing traffic congestion and optimizing urban mobility. Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \textit{M}ultimodal framework, \textit{MTP}, for urban \textit{T}raffic \textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10222v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10222v1)

**摘要**:

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled understanding of both speech and non-speech audio, but exposing new safety risks emerging from complex audio inputs that are inadequately handled by current safeguards. We introduce SACRED-Bench (Speech-Audio Composition for RED-teaming) to evaluate the robustness of LLMs under complex audio-based attacks. Unlike existing perturbation-based methods that rely on noise optimization or white-box access, SACRED-Bench exploits speech-audio composition mechanisms. SACRED-Bench adopts three mechanisms: (a) speech overlap and multi-speaker dialogue, which embeds harmful prompts beneath or alongside benign speech; (b) speech-audio mixture, which imply unsafe intent via non-speech audio alongside benign speech or audio; and (c) diverse spoken instruction formats (open-ended QA, yes/no) that evade text-only filters. Experiments show that, even Gemini 2.5 Pro, the state-of-the-art proprietary LLM, still exhibits 66% attack success rate in SACRED-Bench test set, exposing vulnerabilities under cross-modal, speech-audio composition attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose SALMONN-Guard, a safeguard LLM that jointly inspects speech, audio, and text for safety judgments, reducing attack success down to 20%. Our results highlight the need for audio-aware defenses for the safety of multimodal LLMs. The benchmark and SALMONN-Guard checkpoints can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/SACRED-Bench.

## 377. FedCure: Mitigating Participation Bias in Semi-Asynchronous Federated Learning with Non-IID Data

**作者**: Yue Chen, Jianfeng Lu, Shuqing Cao, Wei Wang, Gang Li, Guanghui Wen

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10227v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10227v1)

**摘要**:

While semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) combines the efficiency of synchronous training with the flexibility of asynchronous updates, it inherently suffers from participation bias, which is further exacerbated by non-IID data distributions. More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.

## 378. LangGPS: Language Separability Guided Data Pre-Selection for Joint Multilingual Instruction Tuning

**作者**: Yangfan Ye, Xiaocheng Feng, Xiachong Feng, Lei Huang, Weitao Ma, Qichen Hong, Yunfei Lu, Duyu Tang, Dandan Tu, Bing Qin

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10229v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10229v1)

**摘要**:

Joint multilingual instruction tuning is a widely adopted approach to improve the multilingual instruction-following ability and downstream performance of large language models (LLMs), but the resulting multilingual capability remains highly sensitive to the composition and selection of the training data. Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.

## 379. VocalNet-M2: Advancing Low-Latency Spoken Language Modeling via Integrated Multi-Codebook Tokenization and Multi-Token Prediction

**作者**: Yuhao Wang, Ziyang Cheng, Heyang Liu, Ronghua Wu, Qunshan Gu, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10232v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10232v1)

**摘要**:

Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

## 380. Bridging Synthetic and Real Routing Problems via LLM-Guided Instance Generation and Progressive Adaptation

**作者**: Jianghan Zhu, Yaoxin Wu, Zhuoyi Lin, Zhengyuan Zhang, Haiyan Yin, Zhiguang Cao, Senthilnath Jayavelu, Xiaoli Li

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10233v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10233v1)

**摘要**:

Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

## 381. Lost in Serialization: Invariance and Generalization of LLM Graph Reasoners

**作者**: Daniel Herbst, Lea Karbeska, Divyanshu Kumar, Akanksha Ahuja, Fatemeh Gholamzadeh Nasrabadi, Fabrizio Frasca

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10234v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10234v1)

**摘要**:

While promising, graph reasoners based on Large Language Models (LLMs) lack built-in invariance to symmetries in graph representations. Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.

**作者**: Minbae Park, Hyemin Yang, Jeonghyun Kim, Kunsoo Park, Hyunjoon Kim

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10240v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10240v1)

**摘要**:

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

**作者**: Jinxuan Li, Yi Zhang, Jian-Fang Hu, Chaolei Tan, Tianming Liang, Beihao Xia

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10241v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10241v1)

**摘要**:

Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube that corresponds to a given language query in an untrimmed video. This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

**作者**: Vincent Schilling, Akshat Dubey, Georges Hattab

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10244v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10244v1)

**摘要**:

Peptide classification tasks, such as predicting toxicity and HIV inhibition, are fundamental to bioinformatics and drug discovery. Traditional approaches rely heavily on handcrafted encodings of one-dimensional (1D) peptide sequences, which can limit generalizability across tasks and datasets. Recently, protein language models (PLMs), such as ESM-2 and ESMFold, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. However, they face two critical challenges. First, fine-tuning is computationally costly. Second, their complex latent representations hinder interpretability for domain experts. Additionally, many frameworks have been developed for specific types of peptide classification, lacking generalization. These limitations restrict the ability to connect model predictions to biologically relevant motifs and structural properties. To address these limitations, we present PepTriX, a novel framework that integrates one dimensional (1D) sequence embeddings and three-dimensional (3D) structural features via a graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention. PepTriX automatically adapts to diverse datasets, producing task-specific peptide vectors while retaining biological plausibility. After evaluation by domain experts, we found that PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical motifs that drive predictions. Thus, PepTriX offers both predictive robustness and interpretable validation, bridging the gap between performance-driven peptide-level models (PLMs) and domain-level understanding in peptide research.

## 385. Robustness and Imperceptibility Analysis of Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Domain Image Watermarking

**作者**: Rizal Khoirul Anam

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.MM]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**DOI**: [10.5281/zenodo.17575139](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17575139)

**摘要**:

The proliferation of digital media necessitates robust methods for copyright protection and content authentication. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of digital image watermarking techniques implemented using the spatial domain (Least Significant Bit - LSB), the frequency domain (Discrete Fourier Transform - DFT), and a novel hybrid (LSB+DFT) approach. The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between imperceptibility (measured by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio - PSNR) and robustness (measured by Normalized Correlation - NC and Bit Error Rate - BER). We implemented these three techniques within a unified MATLAB-based experimental framework. The watermarked images were subjected to a battery of common image processing attacks, including JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and salt-and-pepper noise, at varying intensities. Experimental results generated from standard image datasets (USC-SIPI) demonstrate that while LSB provides superior imperceptibility, it is extremely fragile. The DFT method offers significant robustness at the cost of visual quality. The proposed hybrid LSB+DFT technique, which leverages redundant embedding and a fallback extraction mechanism, is shown to provide the optimal balance, maintaining high visual fidelity while exhibiting superior resilience to all tested attacks.

**作者**: Yongji Zhang, Siqi Li, Yue Gao, Yu Jiang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10250v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10250v1)

**摘要**:

Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

## 387. Heuristic Transformer: Belief Augmented In-Context Reinforcement Learning

**作者**: Oliver Dippel, Alexei Lisitsa, Bei Peng

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10251v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10251v1)

**摘要**:

Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling applications across natural language processing, computer vision, and sequential decision-making. In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.

**作者**: Jiulong Wu, Yucheng Shen, Lingyong Yan, Haixin Sun, Deguo Xia, Jizhou Huang, Min Cao

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10254v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10254v1)

**摘要**:

Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) extends traditional facial emotion recognition by incorporating explainable, fine-grained reasoning. The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10255v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10255v1)

**摘要**:

Reliable, generalizable data foundations are critical for enabling large-scale models in computational lithography. However, essential tasks-mask generation, rule violation detection, and layout optimization-are often handled in isolation, hindered by scarce datasets and limited modeling approaches. To address these challenges, we introduce Unitho, a unified multi-task large vision model built upon the Transformer architecture. Trained on a large-scale industrial lithography simulation dataset with hundreds of thousands of cases, Unitho supports end-to-end mask generation, lithography simulation, and rule violation detection. By enabling agile and high-fidelity lithography simulation, Unitho further facilitates the construction of robust data foundations for intelligent EDA. Experimental results validate its effectiveness and generalizability, with performance substantially surpassing academic baselines.

**arXiv**: [2511.10258v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10258v1)

**摘要**:

This paper presents a novel approach to categorization of modern workload schedulers.

In summary, we discuss differences between all presented classes of schedulers and discuss their chronological development. In conclusion we highlight similarities in the focus of scheduling strategies design, applicable to both local and distributed systems.

## 391. H3Former: Hypergraph-based Semantic-Aware Aggregation via Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss for Fine-Grained Visual Classification

**作者**: Yongji Zhang, Siqi Li, Kuiyang Huang, Yue Gao, Yu Jiang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10260v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10260v1)

**摘要**:

Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) remains a challenging task due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations. Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.

## 392. MTR-DuplexBench: Towards a Comprehensive Evaluation of Multi-Round Conversations for Full-Duplex Speech Language Models

**作者**: He Zhang, Wenqian Cui, Haoning Xu, Xiaohui Li, Lei Zhu, Shaohua Ma, Irwin King

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10262v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10262v1)

**摘要**:

Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

## 393. Beyond Single-Step Updates: Reinforcement Learning of Heuristics with Limited-Horizon Search

**作者**: Gal Hadar, Forest Agostinelli, Shahaf S. Shperberg

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10264v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10264v1)

**摘要**:

Many sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as shortest-path problems, where the objective is to reach a goal state from a given starting state. Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state. Recent approaches leverage reinforcement learning to learn heuristics by applying deep approximate value iteration. These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10266v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10266v1)

**摘要**:

Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are compact graphical representations used to model probabilistic systems where interdependent random variables and their distributions evolve over time. In this paper, we study the verification of the evolution of conditional-independence (CI) propositions against temporal logic specifications. To this end, we consider two specification formalisms over CI propositions: linear temporal logic (LTL), and non-deterministic Büchi automata (NBAs). This problem has two variants. Stochastic CI properties take the given concrete probability distributions into account, while structural CI properties are viewed purely in terms of the graphical structure of the DBN. We show that deciding if a stochastic CI proposition eventually holds is at least as hard as the Skolem problem for linear recurrence sequences, a long-standing open problem in number theory. On the other hand, we show that verifying the evolution of structural CI propositions against LTL and NBA specifications is in PSPACE, and is NP- and coNP-hard. We also identify natural restrictions on the graphical structure of DBNs that make the verification of structural CI properties tractable.

## 395. Causal-HalBench: Uncovering LVLMs Object Hallucinations Through Causal Intervention

**作者**: Zhe Xu, Zhicai Wang, Junkang Wu, Jinda Lu, Xiang Wang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10268v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10268v1)

**摘要**:

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, making erroneous judgments about the presence of objects in images. We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10269v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10269v1)

**摘要**:

Most our knowledge about rocky exoplanets is based on their measure of mass and radius. These two parameters are routinely measured and are used to categorise different populations of observed exoplanets. They are also tightly linked to the planet's properties, in particular those of the interior. As such they offer the unique opportunity to interpret the observations and potentially infer the planet's chemistry and structure. Required for the interpretation are models of planetary interiors, calculated a priori, constrained using other available data, and based on the physiochemical properties of mineralogical phases. This article offers an overview of the current knowledge about exoplanet interiors, the fundamental aspects and tools for interior modelling and how to improve the contraints on the models, along with a discussion on the sources of uncertainty. The origin and fate of volatiles, and their role in planetary evolution is discussed. The chemistry and structure of planetary interiors have a pivotal role in the thermal evolution of planets and the development of large scale properties that might become observables with future space missions and ground-based surveys. As such, having reliable and well constrained interior models is of the utmost importance for the advancement of the field.

**作者**: Xin Sun, Daniel Ståhl, Kristian Sandahl, Christoph Kessler

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.SE]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10271v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10271v1)

**摘要**:

In recent years, LLMs have been widely integrated into software engineering workflows, supporting tasks like code generation. However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality.

**作者**: Shahaf S. Shperberg, Natalie Morad, Lior Siag, Ariel Felner, Dor Atzmon

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10272v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10272v1)

**摘要**:

Recent advancements in bidirectional heuristic search have yielded significant theoretical insights and novel algorithms. While most previous work has concentrated on optimal search methods, this paper focuses on bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, where a bound on the suboptimality of the solution cost is specified. We build upon the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm, BAE*, designed for consistent heuristics, and introduce several variants of BAE* specifically tailored for the bounded-suboptimal context. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the performance of these new variants against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms as well as the standard weighted A* algorithm. Our results demonstrate that each algorithm excels under distinct conditions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10275v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10275v1)

**摘要**:

Despite heat flux's role in regulating energy conversion in collisionless plasmas, its properties and evolution in the magnetosheath downstream of the Earth's bow shock are scarcely explored. We use MMS in situ measurements to quantify and characterize the electron heat flux in the magnetosheath. We find that the heat flux is shaped by the magnetosheath magnetic field as it drapes around the magnetosphere. While it is affected by solar wind upstream conditions and increases with magnetic field strength, it is not substantially changed by local magnetosheath processes. Also, the heat flux is limited by whistler instability thresholds.

**arXiv**: [2511.10276v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10276v1)

**摘要**:

Most existing robotic manipulation benchmarks focus on simplified tabletop scenarios, typically involving a stationary robotic arm interacting with various objects on a flat surface. To address this limitation, we introduce RoboBenchMart, a more challenging and realistic benchmark designed for dark store environments, where robots must perform complex manipulation tasks with diverse grocery items. This setting presents significant challenges, including dense object clutter and varied spatial configurations -- with items positioned at different heights, depths, and in close proximity. By targeting the retail domain, our benchmark addresses a setting with strong potential for near-term automation impact. We demonstrate that current state-of-the-art generalist models struggle to solve even common retail tasks. To support further research, we release the RoboBenchMart suite, which includes a procedural store layout generator, a trajectory generation pipeline, evaluation tools and fine-tuned baseline models.

## 401. Fixed-Persona SLMs with Modular Memory: Scalable NPC Dialogue on Consumer Hardware

**作者**: Martin Braas, Lukas Esterle

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10277v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10277v1)

**摘要**:

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, yet their applicability to dialogue systems in computer games remains limited. This limitation arises from their substantial hardware requirements, latency constraints, and the necessity to maintain clearly defined knowledge boundaries within a game setting. In this paper, we propose a modular NPC dialogue system that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned to encode specific NPC personas and integrated with runtime-swappable memory modules. These memory modules preserve character-specific conversational context and world knowledge, enabling expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay. We comprehensively evaluate our system using three open-source SLMs: DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct, trained on synthetic persona-aligned data and benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware. While our approach is motivated by applications in gaming, its modular design and persona-driven memory architecture hold significant potential for broader adoption in domains requiring expressive, scalable, and memory-rich conversational agents, such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or interactive educational systems.

**作者**: Yanbei Jiang, Chao Lei, Yihao Ding, Krista Ehinger, Jey Han Lau

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10279v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10279v1)

**摘要**:

Despite significant progress, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with complex visual reasoning, where multi-step dependencies cause early errors to cascade through the reasoning chain. Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks. The code isavailable at: https://github.com/YanbeiJiang/PROPA.

## 403. FactGuard: Event-Centric and Commonsense-Guided Fake News Detection

**作者**: Jing He, Han Zhang, Yuanhui Xiao, Wei Guo, Shaowen Yao, Renyang Liu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10281v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10281v1)

**摘要**:

Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

**作者**: Adrien Lafage, Olivier Laurent, Firas Gabetni, Gianni Franchi

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10282v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10282v1)

**摘要**:

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, they often struggle to accurately quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, limiting their broader adoption in critical real-world applications. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Deep Learning seeks to address this challenge by providing methods to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates. Although numerous techniques have been proposed, a unified tool offering a seamless workflow to evaluate and integrate these methods remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce Torch-Uncertainty, a PyTorch and Lightning-based framework designed to streamline DNN training and evaluation with UQ techniques and metrics. In this paper, we outline the foundational principles of our library and present comprehensive experimental results that benchmark a diverse set of UQ methods across classification, segmentation, and regression tasks.

## 405. Beyond Verification: Abductive Explanations for Post-AI Assessment of Privacy Leakage

**作者**: Belona Sonna, Alban Grastien, Claire Benn

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10284v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10284v1)

**摘要**:

Privacy leakage in AI-based decision processes poses significant risks, particularly when sensitive information can be inferred. We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features. This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage. Despite computational challenges and simplifying assumptions, our results demonstrate that abductive reasoning enables interpretable privacy auditing, offering a practical pathway to reconcile transparency, model interpretability, and privacy preserving in AI decision-making.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10287v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10287v1)

**摘要**:

Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

## 407. Music Flamingo: Scaling Music Understanding in Audio Language Models

**arXiv**: [2511.10289v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10289v1)

**摘要**:

We introduce Music Flamingo, a novel large audio-language model designed to advance music (including song) understanding in foundational audio models. While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs. We believe this work provides both a benchmark and a foundation for the community to build the next generation of models that engage with music as meaningfully as humans do.

## 408. Causal Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Sample-Efficient IoT Channel Access

**作者**: Aswin Arun, Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas, Rimalpudi Sarvendranath, Walid Saad

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.IT]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10291v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10291v1)

**摘要**:

Despite the advantages of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for wireless use case such as medium access control (MAC), their real-world deployment in Internet of Things (IoT) is hindered by their sample inefficiency. To alleviate this challenge, one can leverage model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) solutions, however, conventional MBRL approaches rely on black-box models that are not interpretable and cannot reason. In contrast, in this paper, a novel causal model-based MARL framework is developed by leveraging tools from causal learn- ing. In particular, the proposed model can explicitly represent causal dependencies between network variables using structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks. Interpretable causal models are then developed to capture how MAC control messages influence observations, how transmission actions determine outcomes, and how channel observations affect rewards. Data augmentation techniques are then used to generate synthetic rollouts using the learned causal model for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Analytical results demonstrate exponential sample complexity gains of causal MBRL over black-box approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce environment interactions by 58%, and yield faster convergence compared to model-free baselines. The proposed approach inherently is also shown to provide interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution, revealing which network conditions drive the policy. The resulting combination of sample efficiency and interpretability establishes causal MBRL as a practical approach for resource-constrained wireless systems.

**摘要**:

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual inputs, which can critically undermine their reliability. Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.

**摘要**:

Solar thermal systems (STS) present a promising avenue for low-carbon heat generation, with a well-running system providing heat at minimal cost and carbon emissions. However, STS can exhibit faults due to improper installation, maintenance, or operation, often resulting in a substantial reduction in efficiency or even damage to the system. As monitoring at the individual level is economically prohibitive for small-scale systems, automated monitoring and fault detection should be used to address such issues. Recent advances in data-driven anomaly detection, particularly in time series analysis, offer a cost-effective solution by leveraging existing sensors to identify abnormal system states.
  Here, we propose a probabilistic reconstruction-based framework for anomaly detection. We evaluate our method on the publicly available PaSTS dataset of operational domestic STS, which features real-world complexities and diverse fault types. Our experiments show that reconstruction-based methods can detect faults in domestic STS both qualitatively and quantitatively, while generalizing to previously unseen systems. We also demonstrate that our model outperforms both simple and more complex deep learning baselines. Additionally, we show that heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation is essential to fault detection performance. Finally, we discuss the engineering overhead required to unlock these improvements and make a case for simple deep learning models.

**摘要**:

Organizations handling sensitive documents face a critical dilemma: adopt cloud-based AI systems that offer powerful question-answering capabilities but compromise data privacy, or maintain local processing that ensures security but delivers poor accuracy. We present a question-answering system that resolves this trade-off by combining semantic understanding with keyword precision, operating entirely on local infrastructure without internet access. Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines. By balancing two complementary retrieval strategies and using consumer-grade hardware acceleration, the system delivers reliable answers with minimal errors, letting banks, hospitals, and law firms adopt conversational document AI without transmitting proprietary information to external providers. This work establishes that privacy and performance need not be mutually exclusive in enterprise AI deployment.

**arXiv**: [2511.10300v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10300v1)

**摘要**:

Satellite-based slum segmentation holds significant promise in generating global estimates of urban poverty. However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions. GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings such as African cities, offering a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning.

**摘要**:

Despite the remarkable success of the LLaVA architecture for vision-language tasks, its design inherently struggles to effectively integrate visual features due to the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities. We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10302v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10302v1)

**摘要**:

Traditional joint source-channel coding employs static learned semantic representations that cannot dynamically adapt to evolving source distributions. Shared semantic memories between transmitter and receiver can potentially enable bandwidth savings by reusing previously transmitted concepts as context to reconstruct data, but require effective mechanisms to determine when current content is similar enough to stored patterns. However, existing hard quantization approaches based on variational autoencoders are limited by frequent memory updates even under small changes in data dynamics, which leads to inefficient usage of bandwidth.To address this challenge, in this paper, a memory-augmented semantic communication framework is proposed where both transmitter and receiver maintain a shared memory of semantic concepts using modern Hopfield networks (MHNs). The proposed framework employs soft attention-based retrieval that smoothly adjusts stored semantic prototype weights as data evolves that enables stable matching decisions under gradual data dynamics. A joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and memory retrieval
  mechanism is performed with the objective of maximizing a reasoning capacity metric that quantifies semantic efficiency as the product of memory reuse rate and compression ratio. Theoretical analysis establishes the fundamental rate-distortion-reuse tradeoff and proves that soft retrieval reduces unnecessary transmissions compared to hard quantization under bounded semantic drift. Extensive simulations over diverse video scenarios demonstrate that the proposed MHN-based approach achieves substantial bit reductions around 14% on average and up to 70% in scenarios with gradual content changes compared to baseline.

**摘要**:

To improve Multi-step Mathematical Reasoning (MsMR) of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to obtain scalable supervision from the corpus by automatically critiquing mistakes in the reasoning process of MsMR and rendering a final verdict of the problem-solution. Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.

**arXiv**: [2511.10308v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10308v1)

**摘要**:

Reliable pedestrian detection represents a crucial step towards automated driving systems. However, the current performance benchmarks exhibit weaknesses. The currently applied metrics for various subsets of a validation dataset prohibit a realistic performance evaluation of a DNN for pedestrian detection. As image segmentation supplies fine-grained information about a street scene, it can serve as a starting point to automatically distinguish between different types of errors during the evaluation of a pedestrian detector. In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories. We use the new metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of the APD, and show a more fine-grained and robust way to compare models with each other especially in terms of safety-critical performance. We achieve SOTA on CityPersons-reasonable (without extra training data) by using a rather simple architecture.

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10309v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10309v1)

**摘要**:

This paper proposes a novel CLIP-driven modality-shared representation learning network named CLIP4VI-ReID for VI-ReID task, which consists of Text Semantic Generation (TSG), Infrared Feature Embedding (IFE), and High-level Semantic Alignment (HSA). Specifically, considering the huge gap in the physical characteristics between natural images and infrared images, the TSG is designed to generate text semantics only for visible images, thereby enabling preliminary visible-text modality alignment. Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP4VI-ReID achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art methods on some widely used VI-ReID datasets.

**arXiv**: [2511.10310v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10310v1)

**摘要**:

Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are integral to future 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, their deployment is hindered by challenges stemming from high mobility of UAVs, complex propagation environments, and the inherent trade-offs between coexisting sensing and communication functions. This article proposes a novel framework that leverages movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as dual enablers to overcome these limitations. MAs, through active transceiver reconfiguration, and IRSs, via passive channel reconstruction, can work in synergy to significantly enhance system performance. Our analysis first elaborates on the fundamental gains offered by MAs and IRSs, and provides simulation results that validate the immense potential of the MA-IRS-enabled ISAC architecture. Two core UAV deployment scenarios are then investigated: (i) UAVs as ISAC users, where we focus on achieving high-precision tracking and aerial safety, and (ii) UAVs as aerial network nodes, where we address robust design and complex coupled resource optimization. Finally, key technical challenges and research opportunities are identified and analyzed for each scenario, charting a clear course for the future design of advanced low-altitude ISAC networks.

**作者**: Yu Deng, Baozhu Zhao, Junyan Su, Xiaohan Zhang, Qi Liu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10316v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10316v1)

**摘要**:

Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

## 420. PITE: Multi-Prototype Alignment for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation

**作者**: Fuyuan Cao, Jiaxuan Zhang, Xiaoli Li

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10320v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10320v1)

**摘要**:

Estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) from observational data is challenging due to confounding bias. Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \textbf{ITE} estimation (\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PITE outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate and robust ITE estimation.

**arXiv**: [2511.10333v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10333v1)

**摘要**:

Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

## 422. Learning to Tell Apart: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection via Disentangled Semantic Alignment

**作者**: Wenti Yin, Huaxin Zhang, Xiang Wang, Yuqing Lu, Yicheng Zhang, Bingquan Gong, Jialong Zuo, Li Yu, Changxin Gao, Nong Sang

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10334v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10334v1)

**摘要**:

Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

**摘要**:

In the context of pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data has emerged as an alternative for generating high-quality pretraining data at scale. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts. Empirical results through model runs reveal key trade-offs in generation strategies and highlight best practices for constructing effective multilingual corpora.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10339v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10339v1)

**摘要**:

Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our solver achieves a significantly improved 332.9$\times$ speedup when run on 1024 cores, enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime and to generate proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex. Despite exponential growth in game tree size, our solver verified the Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions, nearly doubling the number of known outcomes.

**作者**: Marien Renaud, Eliot Guez, Arthur Leclaire, Nicolas Papadakis

**期刊**: arXiv [eess.IV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10340v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10340v1)

**摘要**:

One key ingredient of image restoration is to define a realistic prior on clean images to complete the missing information in the observation. State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose two unified frameworks named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) and Equivariant Plug-and-Play (EPnP) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithms and discuss their practical benefit.

## 426. Robust Decentralized Multi-armed Bandits: From Corruption-Resilience to Byzantine-Resilience

**作者**: Zicheng Hu, Yuchen Wang, Cheng Chen

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10344v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10344v1)

**摘要**:

Decentralized cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (DeCMA2B) considers how multiple agents collaborate in a decentralized multi-armed bandit setting. Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information. We also conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

## 427. FOUND: Fourier-based von Mises Distribution for Robust Single Domain Generalization in Object Detection

**作者**: Mengzhu Wang, Changyuan Deng, Shanshan Wang, Nan Yin, Long Lan, Liang Yang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10352v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10352v1)

**摘要**:

Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for object detection aims to train a model on a single source domain that can generalize effectively to unseen target domains. While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains. Extensive experiments on the diverse weather-driving benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method.

## 428. Knowledge Graphs Generation from Cultural Heritage Texts: Combining LLMs and Ontological Engineering for Scholarly Debates

**作者**: Andrea Schimmenti, Valentina Pasqual, Fabio Vitali, Marieke van Erp

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10354v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10354v1)

**摘要**:

Cultural Heritage texts contain rich knowledge that is difficult to query systematically due to the challenges of converting unstructured discourse into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.

## 429. SITA: A Framework for Structure-to-Instance Theorem Autoformalization

**作者**: Chenyi Li, Wanli Ma, Zichen Wang, Zaiwen Wen

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10356v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10356v1)

**摘要**:

While large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in mathematical reasoning, they still face challenges in formalizing theorems that arise from instantiating abstract structures in concrete settings. With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions. We incorporate LLM-based generation with feedback-guided refinement to ensure both automation and formal correctness. Experiments on a dataset of optimization problems demonstrate that SITA effectively formalizes diverse instances grounded in abstract structures.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10362v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10362v1)

**摘要**:

The paper surveys recent progresses in understanding the dynamics and loss landscape of the gradient flow equations associated to deep linear neural networks, i.e., the gradient descent training dynamics (in the limit when the step size goes to 0) of deep neural networks missing the activation functions and subject to quadratic loss functions. When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.

## 431. Product distribution learning with imperfect advice

**作者**: Arnab Bhattacharyya, Davin Choo, Philips George John, Themis Gouleakis

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10366v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10366v1)

**摘要**:

Given i.i.d.~samples from an unknown distribution $P$, the goal of distribution learning is to recover the parameters of a distribution that is close to $P$. When $P$ belongs to the class of product distributions on the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^d$, it is known that $Ω(d/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary to learn $P$ within total variation (TV) distance $\varepsilon$. We revisit this problem when the learner is also given as advice the parameters of a product distribution $Q$. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to learn $P$ within TV distance $\varepsilon$ that has sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d^{1-η}/\varepsilon^2)$, if $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1 < \varepsilon d^{0.5 - Ω(η)}$. Here, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are the mean vectors of $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and no bound on $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1$ is known to the algorithm a priori.

**arXiv**: [2511.10367v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10367v1)

**摘要**:

AI-based dermatology adoption remains limited by biased datasets, variable image quality, and limited validation. We introduce DermAI, a lightweight, smartphone-based application that enables real-time capture, annotation, and classification of skin lesions during routine consultations. Unlike prior dermoscopy-focused tools, DermAI performs on-device quality checks, and local model adaptation. The DermAI clinical dataset, encompasses a wide range of skin tones, ethinicity and source devices. In preliminary experiments, models trained on public datasets failed to generalize to our samples, while fine-tuning with local data improved performance. These results highlight the importance of standardized, diverse data collection aligned with healthcare needs and oriented to machine learning development.

**arXiv**: [2511.10370v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10370v1)

**摘要**:

Geospatial foundation models for Earth observation often fail to perform reliably in environments underrepresented during pretraining. We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

## 434. TruthfulRAG: Resolving Factual-level Conflicts in Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Knowledge Graphs

**作者**: Shuyi Liu, Yuming Shang, Xi Zhang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10375v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10375v1)

**摘要**:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval-based methods with generative models. As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.

## 435. MSGNav: Unleashing the Power of Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph for Zero-Shot Embodied Navigation

**作者**: Xun Huang, Shijia Zhao, Yunxiang Wang, Xin Lu, Wanfa Zhang, Rongsheng Qu, Weixin Li, Yunhong Wang, Chenglu Wen

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10376v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10376v1)

**摘要**:

Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets. The open-source code will be publicly available.

## 436. Position: On the Methodological Pitfalls of Evaluating Base LLMs for Reasoning

**作者**: Jason Chan, Zhixue Zhao, Robert Gaizauskas

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10381v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10381v1)

**摘要**:

Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes. Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.

## 437. Fragile by Design: On the Limits of Adversarial Defenses in Personalized Generation

**作者**: Zhen Chen, Yi Zhang, Xiangyu Yin, Chengxuan Qin, Xingyu Zhao, Xiaowei Huang, Wenjie Ruan

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10382v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10382v1)

**摘要**:

Personalized AI applications such as DreamBooth enable the generation of customized content from user images, but also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly the risk of facial identity leakage. Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.

## 438. Operator Models for Continuous-Time Offline Reinforcement Learning

**作者**: Nicolas Hoischen, Petar Bevanda, Max Beier, Stefan Sosnowski, Boris Houska, Sandra Hirche

**期刊**: arXiv [stat.ML]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10383v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10383v1)

**摘要**:

Continuous-time stochastic processes underlie many natural and engineered systems. In healthcare, autonomous driving, and industrial control, direct interaction with the environment is often unsafe or impractical, motivating offline reinforcement learning from historical data. However, there is limited statistical understanding of the approximation errors inherent in learning policies from offline datasets. We address this by linking reinforcement learning to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and proposing an operator-theoretic algorithm based on a simple dynamic programming recursion. Specifically, we represent our world model in terms of the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes learned in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. By integrating statistical learning methods and operator theory, we establish global convergence of the value function and derive finite-sample guarantees with bounds tied to system properties such as smoothness and stability. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that operator-based approaches may hold promise in solving offline reinforcement learning using continuous-time optimal control.

## 439. Simulating Misinformation Propagation in Social Networks using Large Language Models

**作者**: Raj Gaurav Maurya, Vaibhav Shukla, Raj Abhijit Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.SI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10384v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10384v1)

**摘要**:

Misinformation on social media thrives on surprise, emotion, and identity-driven reasoning, often amplified through human cognitive biases. To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.

## 440. SAMIRO: Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a Pre-trained Model as Oracle for Lane Detection

**作者**: Hyunjong Lee, Jangho Lee, Jaekoo Lee

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10385v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10385v1)

**摘要**:

Lane detection is an important topic in the future mobility solutions. Real-world environmental challenges such as background clutter, varying illumination, and occlusions pose significant obstacles to effective lane detection, particularly when relying on data-driven approaches that require substantial effort and cost for data collection and annotation. To address these issues, lane detection methods must leverage contextual and global information from surrounding lanes and objects. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS. The results demonstrate that SAMIRO consistently improves performance across different models and datasets. The code will be made available upon publication.

**作者**: Prince Mensah, Pelumi Victor Aderinto, Ibrahim Salihu Yusuf, Arnu Pretorius

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10387v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10387v1)

**摘要**:

Accurate retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables from satellite imagery is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and agricultural management. In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring. The proposed approach illustrates how integrating physical models with advanced deep networks can improve the inversion of RTMs, opening new prospects for large-scale, physically-constrained remote sensing of vegetation traits.

**作者**: Jiarui Zhang, Yuliang Liu, Zijun Wu, Guosheng Pang, Zhili Ye, Yupei Zhong, Junteng Ma, Tao Wei, Haiyang Xu, Weikai Chen *et al.* (20 authors)

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10390v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10390v1)

**摘要**:

Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

**作者**: Oussema Dhaouadi, Johannes Meier, Jacques Kaiser, Daniel Cremers

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10391v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10391v1)

**摘要**:

Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) represent the bare-earth elevation and are important in numerous geospatial applications. Such data models cannot be directly measured by sensors and are typically generated from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) derived from LiDAR or photogrammetry. Traditional filtering approaches rely on manually tuned parameters, while learning-based methods require well-designed architectures, often combined with post-processing. To address these challenges, we introduce Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff), the first diffusion-based framework that iteratively removes non-ground structures by formulating the problem as a denoising task. We incorporate a gated design with confidence-guided generation that enables selective filtering. To increase scalability, we further propose Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which employs a downsampled global prior automatically generated using GrounDiff to guide local high-resolution predictions. We evaluate our method on the DSM-to-DTM translation task across diverse datasets, showing that GrounDiff consistently outperforms deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In the task of road reconstruction, which requires both high precision and smoothness, our method achieves up to 81% lower distance error compared to specialized techniques on the GeRoD benchmark, while maintaining competitive surface smoothness using only DSM inputs, without task-specific optimization. Our variant for road reconstruction, GrounDiff+, is specifically designed to produce even smoother surfaces, further surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

## 444. Enhancing Kernel Power K-means: Scalable and Robust Clustering with Random Fourier Features and Possibilistic Method

**作者**: Yixi Chen, Weixuan Liang, Tianrui Liu, Jun-Jie Huang, Ao Li, Xueling Zhu, Xinwang Liu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10392v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10392v1)

**摘要**:

Kernel power $k$-means (KPKM) leverages a family of means to mitigate local minima issues in kernel $k$-means. However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and clustering accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

## 445. LLM-YOLOMS: Large Language Model-based Semantic Interpretation and Fault Diagnosis for Wind Turbine Components

**作者**: Yaru Li, Yanxue Wang, Meng Li, Xinming Li, Jianbo Feng

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10394v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10394v1)

**摘要**:

The health condition of wind turbine (WT) components is crucial for ensuring stable and reliable operation. However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10395v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10395v1)

**摘要**:

Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

## 447. Rethinking the Reliability of Multi-agent System: A Perspective from Byzantine Fault Tolerance

**作者**: Lifan Zheng, Jiawei Chen, Qinghong Yin, Jingyuan Zhang, Xinyi Zeng, Yu Tian

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.MA]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10400v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10400v1)

**摘要**:

Ensuring the reliability of agent architectures and effectively identifying problematic agents when failures occur are crucial challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS). Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.

**作者**: Mingxing Peng, Ruoyu Yao, Xusen Guo, Jun Ma

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.RO]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10403v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10403v1)

**摘要**:

Recent advances in closed-loop planning benchmarks have significantly improved the evaluation of autonomous vehicles. However, existing benchmarks still rely on rule-based reactive agents such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), which lack behavioral diversity and fail to capture realistic human interactions, leading to oversimplified traffic dynamics. To address these limitations, we present nuPlan-R, a new reactive closed-loop planning benchmark that integrates learning-based reactive multi-agent simulation into the nuPlan framework. Our benchmark replaces the rule-based IDM agents with noise-decoupled diffusion-based reactive agents and introduces an interaction-aware agent selection mechanism to ensure both realism and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we extend the benchmark with two additional metrics to enable a more comprehensive assessment of planning performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reactive agent model produces more realistic, diverse, and human-like traffic behaviors, leading to a benchmark environment that better reflects real-world interactive driving. We further reimplement a collection of rule-based, learning-based, and hybrid planning approaches within our nuPlan-R benchmark, providing a clearer reflection of planner performance in complex interactive scenarios and better highlighting the advantages of learning-based planners in handling complex and dynamic scenarios. These results establish nuPlan-R as a new standard for fair, reactive, and realistic closed-loop planning evaluation. We will open-source the code for the new benchmark.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10404v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10404v1)

**摘要**:

In spite of the remarkable advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing, the task of Entity Linking (EL) remains challenging in the field of humanities due to complex document typologies, lack of domain-specific datasets and models, and long-tail entities, i.e., entities under-represented in Knowledge Bases (KBs). The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters. Moreover, further analyses reveal how DELICATE confidence scores and features sensitivity provide results which are more explainable and interpretable than purely neural methods.

## 450. Diffusion annealed Langevin dynamics: a theoretical study

**作者**: Patrick Cattiaux, Paula Cordero-Encinar, Arnaud Guillin

**期刊**: arXiv [math.PR]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10406v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10406v1)

**摘要**:

In this work we study the diffusion annealed Langevin dynamics, a score-based diffusion process recently introduced in the theory of generative models and which is an alternative to the classical overdamped Langevin diffusion. Our goal is to provide a rigorous construction and to study the theoretical efficiency of these models for general base distribution as well as target distribution. As a matter of fact these diffusion processes are a particular case of Nelson processes i.e. diffusion processes with a given flow of time marginals.
  Providing existence and uniqueness of the solution to the annealed Langevin diffusion leads to proving a Poincaré inequality for the conditional distribution of $X$ knowing $X+Z=y$ uniformly in $y$, as recently observed by one of us and her coauthors. Part of this work is thus devoted to the study of such Poincaré inequalities. Additionally we show that strengthening the Poincaré inequality into a logarithmic Sobolev inequality improves the efficiency of the model.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10409v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10409v1)

**摘要**:

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant interest in recent years, enabling sequential decision-making across multiple agents in various domains. However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings. We propose methods to generate policy summarizations that capture task ordering and agent cooperation in decentralized MARL policies, along with query-based explanations for When, Why Not, and What types of user queries about specific agent behaviors. We evaluate our approach across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its generalizability and computational efficiency. User studies show that our summarizations and explanations significantly improve user question-answering performance and enhance subjective ratings on metrics such as understanding and satisfaction.

**arXiv**: [2511.10412v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10412v1)

**摘要**:

Acquiring standard facial planes during routine fetal ultrasound (US) examinations is often challenging due to fetal movement, variability in orientation, and operator-dependent expertise. These factors contribute to inconsistencies, increased examination time, and potential diagnostic bias.
  To address these challenges in the context of facial assessment, we present: 1) GT++, a robust algorithm that estimates standard facial planes from 3D US volumes using annotated anatomical landmarks; and 2) 3DFETUS, a deep learning model that automates and standardizes their localization in 3D fetal US volumes.
  We evaluated our methods both qualitatively, through expert clinical review, and quantitatively. The proposed approach achieved a mean translation error of 4.13 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.93 degrees per plane, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on 3D US volumes. Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.

## 453. Generalizing Analogical Inference from Boolean to Continuous Domains

**作者**: Francisco Cunha, Yves Lepage, Zied Bouraoui, Miguel Couceiro

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10416v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10416v1)

**摘要**:

Analogical reasoning is a powerful inductive mechanism, widely used in human cognition and increasingly applied in artificial intelligence. Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions. Our results offer a general theory of analogical inference across discrete and continuous domains.

## 454. Domain Adaptation for Camera-Specific Image Characteristics using Shallow Discriminators

**作者**: Maximiliane Gruber, Jürgen Seiler, André Kaup

**期刊**: arXiv [eess.IV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10424v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10424v1)

**摘要**:

Each image acquisition setup leads to its own camera-specific image characteristics degrading the image quality. In learning-based perception algorithms, characteristics occurring during the application phase, but absent in the training data, lead to a domain gap impeding the performance. Previously, pixel-level domain adaptation through unpaired learning of the pristine-to-distorted mapping function has been proposed. In this work, we propose shallow discriminator architectures to address limitations of these approaches. We show that a smaller receptive field size improves learning of unknown image distortions by more accurately reproducing local distortion characteristics at a low network complexity. In a domain adaptation setup for instance segmentation, we achieve mean average precision increases over previous methods of up to 0.15 for individual distortions and up to 0.16 for camera-specific image characteristics in a simplified camera model. In terms of number of parameters, our approach matches the complexity of one state of the art method while reducing complexity by a factor of 20 compared to another, demonstrating superior efficiency without compromising performance.

## 455. Using Certifying Constraint Solvers for Generating Step-wise Explanations

**作者**: Ignace Bleukx, Maarten Flippo, Bart Bogaerts, Emir Demirović, Tias Guns

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10428v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10428v1)

**摘要**:

In the field of Explainable Constraint Solving, it is common to explain to a user why a problem is unsatisfiable. A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small. Our results show our method significantly speeds up the generation of step-wise explanation sequences, while the resulting step-wise explanation has a quality similar to the current state-of-the-art.

**DOI**: [10.5281/zenodo.17601357](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17601357)

**摘要**:

We introduce a curated video dataset of laboratory rodents for automatic detection of convulsive events. The dataset contains short (10~s) top-down and side-view video clips of individual rodents, labeled at clip level as normal activity or seizure. It includes 10,101 negative samples and 2,952 positive samples collected from 19 subjects. We describe the data curation, annotation protocol and preprocessing pipeline, and report baseline experiments using a transformer-based video classifier (TimeSformer). Experiments employ five-fold cross-validation with strict subject-wise partitioning to prevent data leakage (no subject appears in more than one fold). Results show that the TimeSformer architecture enables discrimination between seizure and normal activity with an average F1-score of 97%. The dataset and baseline code are publicly released to support reproducible research on non-invasive, video-based monitoring in preclinical epilepsy research.

**arXiv**: [2511.10432v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10432v1)

**摘要**:

Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

## 458. Unlocking Dynamic Inter-Client Spatial Dependencies: A Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Method for Traffic Flow Forecasting

**作者**: Feng Wang, Tianxiang Chen, Shuyue Wei, Qian Chu, Yi Zhang, Yifan Sun, Zhiming Zheng

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10434v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10434v1)

**摘要**:

Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.

## 459. Neuronal Fluctuations: Learning Rates vs Participating Neurons

**作者**: Darsh Pareek, Umesh Kumar, Ruthu Rao, Ravi Janjam

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10435v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10435v1)

**摘要**:

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) rely on inherent fluctuations in their internal parameters (weights and biases) to effectively navigate the complex optimization landscape and achieve robust performance. While these fluctuations are recognized as crucial for escaping local minima and improving generalization, their precise relationship with fundamental hyperparameters remains underexplored. A significant knowledge gap exists concerning how the learning rate, a critical parameter governing the training process, directly influences the dynamics of these neural fluctuations. This study systematically investigates the impact of varying learning rates on the magnitude and character of weight and bias fluctuations within a neural network. We trained a model using distinct learning rates and analyzed the corresponding parameter fluctuations in conjunction with the network's final accuracy. Our findings aim to establish a clear link between the learning rate's value, the resulting fluctuation patterns, and overall model performance. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the optimization process, shedding light on how the learning rate mediates the crucial exploration-exploitation trade-off during training. This work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of hyperparameter tuning and the underlying mechanics of deep learning.

## 460. Preference Elicitation for Step-Wise Explanations in Logic Puzzles

**作者**: Marco Foschini, Marianne Defresne, Emilio Gamba, Bart Bogaerts, Tias Guns

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10436v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10436v1)

**摘要**:

Step-wise explanations can explain logic puzzles and other satisfaction problems by showing how to derive decisions step by step. Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation. In both settings, MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than the standard approach.

## 461. Improving Perturbation-based Explanations by Understanding the Role of Uncertainty Calibration

**作者**: Thomas Decker, Volker Tresp, Florian Buettner

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10439v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10439v1)

**摘要**:

Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the transparency of machine-learning models in practice. However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models systematically produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines global and local explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving their original predictions. Empirical evaluations across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively while enhancing explanation robustness and the identification of globally important input features.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10440v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10440v1)

**摘要**:

Protein structure determination has long been one of the primary challenges of structural biology, to which deep machine learning (ML)-based approaches have increasingly been applied. However, these ML models generally do not incorporate the experimental measurements directly, such as X-ray crystallographic diffraction data. To this end, we explore an approach that more tightly couples these traditional crystallographic and recent ML-based methods, by training a hybrid 3-d vision transformer and convolutional network on inputs from both domains. We make use of two distinct input constructs / Patterson maps, which are directly obtainable from crystallographic data, and ``partial structure'' template maps derived from predicted structures deposited in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database with subsequently omitted residues. With these, we predict electron density maps that are then post-processed into atomic models through standard crystallographic refinement processes. Introducing an initial dataset of small protein fragments taken from Protein Data Bank entries and placing them in hypothetical crystal settings, we demonstrate that our method is effective at both improving the phases of the crystallographic structure factors and completing the regions missing from partial structure templates, as well as improving the agreement of the electron density maps with the ground truth atomic structures.

## 463. Analogical Structure, Minimal Contextual Cues and Contrastive Distractors: Input Design for Sample-Efficient Linguistic Rule Induction

**作者**: Chunyang Jiang, Paola Merlo

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10441v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10441v1)

**摘要**:

Large language models achieve strong performance through training on vast datasets. Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$). Ablation studies confirm that analogical organization and contrastive structure improve performance, consistently surpassing randomly shuffled baselines across architectures. Cross-phenomenon validation using unspecified object alternations replicates these efficiency gains, confirming approach robustness. Our results show that analogical paradigm organization enables competitive linguistic rule learning with orders of magnitude less data than conventional approaches require.

**期刊**: arXiv [stat.ML]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10446v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10446v1)

**摘要**:

Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) excel at modeling continuous-time dynamics, effectively handling challenges such as irregular observations, missing values, and noise. Despite their advantages, NDEs face a fundamental challenge in adopting dropout, a cornerstone of deep learning regularization, making them susceptible to overfitting. To address this research gap, we introduce Continuum Dropout, a universally applicable regularization technique for NDEs built upon the theory of alternating renewal processes. Continuum Dropout formulates the on-off mechanism of dropout as a stochastic process that alternates between active (evolution) and inactive (paused) states in continuous time. This provides a principled approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of NDEs. Moreover, Continuum Dropout offers a structured framework to quantify predictive uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling at test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Continuum Dropout outperforms existing regularization methods for NDEs, achieving superior performance on various time series and image classification tasks. It also yields better-calibrated and more trustworthy probability estimates, highlighting its effectiveness for uncertainty-aware modeling.

## 465. Non-Monotonic S4F Standpoint Logic

**作者**: Piotr Gorczyca, Hannes Strass

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10449v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10449v1)

**摘要**:

Standpoint logics offer unified modal logic-based formalisms for representing multiple heterogeneous viewpoints. At the same time, many non-monotonic reasoning frameworks can be naturally captured using modal logics, in particular using the modal logic S4F. In this work, we propose a novel formalism called S4F Standpoint Logic, which generalises both S4F and standpoint propositional logic and is therefore capable of expressing multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments. We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.

## 466. Learning parameter-dependent shear viscosity from data, with application to sea and land ice

**作者**: Gonzalo G. de Diego, Georg Stadler

**期刊**: arXiv [math.NA]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10452v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10452v1)

**摘要**:

Complex physical systems which exhibit fluid-like behavior are often modeled as non-Newtonian fluids. A crucial element of a non-Newtonian model is the rheology, which relates inner stresses with strain-rates. We propose a framework for inferring rheological models from data that represents the fluid's effective viscosity with a neural network. By writing the rheological law in terms of tensor invariants and tailoring the network's properties, the inferred model satisfies key physical and mathematical properties, such as isotropic frame-indifference and existence of a convex potential of dissipation. Within this framework, we propose two approaches to learning a fluid's rheology: 1) a standard regression that fits the rheological model to stress data and 2) a PDE-constrained optimization method that infers rheological models from velocity data. For the latter approach, we combine finite element and machine learning libraries. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method on land and sea ice rheologies which also depend on external parameters. For land ice, we infer the temperature-dependent Glen's law and, for sea ice, the concentration-dependent shear component of the viscous-plastic model. For these two models, we explore the effects of large data errors. Finally, we infer an unknown concentration-dependent model that reproduces Lagrangian ice floe simulation data. Our method discovers a rheology that generalizes well outside of the training dataset and exhibits both shear-thickening and thinning behaviors depending on the concentrations.

## 467. Reasoning About Intent for Ambiguous Requests

**作者**: Irina Saparina, Mirella Lapata

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10453v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10453v1)

**摘要**:

Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.

## 468. Exploring State Tracking Capabilities of Large Language Models

**作者**: Kiamehr Rezaee, Jose Camacho-Collados, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10457v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10457v1)

**摘要**:

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks, including those requiring a certain level of reasoning. In this paper, we focus on state tracking, a problem where models need to keep track of the state governing a number of entities. To isolate the state tracking component from other factors, we propose a benchmark based on three well-defined state tracking tasks and analyse the performance of LLMs in different scenarios. The results indicate that the recent generation of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4 and Llama3) are capable of tracking state, especially when integrated with mechanisms such as Chain of Thought. However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.

## 469. LocalBench: Benchmarking LLMs on County-Level Local Knowledge and Reasoning

**作者**: Zihan Gao, Yifei Xu, Jacob Thebault-Spieker

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10459v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10459v1)

**摘要**:

Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.

## 470. OpenSR-SRGAN: A Flexible Super-Resolution Framework for Multispectral Earth Observation Data

**作者**: Simon Donike, Cesar Aybar, Julio Contreras, Luis Gómez-Chova

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10461v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10461v1)

**摘要**:

We present OpenSR-SRGAN, an open and modular framework for single-image super-resolution in Earth Observation. The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model. It ships with ready-to-use configurations for common remote sensing scenarios, sensible default settings for adversarial training, and built-in hooks for logging, validation, and large-scene inference. By turning GAN-based super-resolution into a configuration-driven workflow, OpenSR-SRGAN lowers the entry barrier for researchers and practitioners who wish to experiment with SRGANs, compare models in a reproducible way, and deploy super-resolution pipelines across diverse Earth-observation datasets.

## 471. Beyond Elicitation: Provision-based Prompt Optimization for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks

**作者**: Yunzhe Xu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Zhe Liu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10465v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10465v1)

**摘要**:

While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

## 472. Intrinsic Dimensionality as a Model-Free Measure of Class Imbalance

**作者**: Çağrı Eser, Zeynep Sonat Baltacı, Emre Akbaş, Sinan Kalkan

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10475v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10475v1)

**摘要**:

Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.

**arXiv**: [2511.10480v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10480v1)

**摘要**:

Optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on large-scale AI training and inference systems requires a scalable and expressive mechanism to model distributed workload execution. Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication. STAGE will be publicly available to facilitate further research in distributed machine learning systems.

**作者**: Ruxi Deng, Wenxuan Bao, Tianxin Wei, Jingrui He

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10481v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10481v1)

**摘要**:

Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

**摘要**:

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.

**作者**: Oded Schlesinger, Amirhossein Farzam, J. Matias Di Martino, Guillermo Sapiro

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10488v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10488v1)

**摘要**:

While Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their computational demands are substantial, scaling quadratically with the number of processed tokens. Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers. Its versatile design supports a range of performance levels adaptable to varying resource constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs, while maintaining or even improving accuracy. Code and models are available at https://github.com/odedsc/SPOT .

**arXiv**: [2511.10492v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10492v1)

**摘要**:

Optimizing recommender systems for objectives beyond accuracy, such as diversity, novelty, and personalization, is crucial for long-term user satisfaction. To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner.
  Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.

## 479. Weak Relation Enforcement for Kinematic-Informed Long-Term Stock Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks

**作者**: Stanislav Selitskiy

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**DOI**: [10.1007/978-3-031-62269-4_18](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-62269-4_18)

**摘要**:

We propose loss function week enforcement of the velocity relations between time-series points in the Kinematic-Informed artificial Neural Networks (KINN) for long-term stock prediction. Problems of the series volatility, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) test data, and outliers in training data are addressed by (Artificial Neural Networks) ANN's learning not only future points prediction but also by learning velocity relations between the points, such a way as avoiding unrealistic spurious predictions. The presented loss function penalizes not only errors between predictions and supervised label data, but also errors between the next point prediction and the previous point plus velocity prediction. The loss function is tested on the multiple popular and exotic AR ANN architectures, and around fifteen years of Dow Jones function demonstrated statistically meaningful improvement across the normalization-sensitive activation functions prone to spurious behaviour in the OOD data conditions. Results show that such architecture addresses the issue of the normalization in the auto-regressive models that break the data topology by weakly enforcing the data neighbourhood proximity (relation) preservation during the ANN transformation.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10500v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10500v1)

**摘要**:

Although Total Variation (TV) performs well in noise reduction and edge preservation on images, its dependence on the lambda parameter limits its efficiency and makes it difficult to use effectively. In this study, we present a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework that couples an unrolled TV solver with a data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) predicting a per-pixel regularization map. The pipeline is trained end-to-end so that reconstruction and regularization are optimized jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing: strong in homogeneous regions, relaxed near anatomical boundaries. Experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, using a realistic noise model adapted from the LoDoPaB-CT methodology, show consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average. LTV provides an interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and a basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/itu-biai/deep_tv_for_ldct

**arXiv**: [2511.10501v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10501v1)

**摘要**:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.

## 482. On the Detectability of Active Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning

**作者**: Vincenzo Carletti, Pasquale Foggia, Carlo Mazzocca, Giuseppe Parrella, Mario Vento

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CR]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10502v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10502v1)

**摘要**:

One of the key advantages of Federated Learning (FL) is its ability to collaboratively train a Machine Learning (ML) model while keeping clients' data on-site. However, this can create a false sense of security. Despite not sharing private data increases the overall privacy, prior studies have shown that gradients exchanged during the FL training remain vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). These attacks allow reconstructing the clients' local data, breaking the privacy promise of FL. GIAs can be launched by either a passive or an active server. In the latter case, a malicious server manipulates the global model to facilitate data reconstruction. While effective, earlier attacks falling under this category have been demonstrated to be detectable by clients, limiting their real-world applicability. Recently, novel active GIAs have emerged, claiming to be far stealthier than previous approaches. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of these claims, investigating four state-of-the-art GIAs. We propose novel lightweight client-side detection techniques, based on statistically improbable weight structures and anomalous loss and gradient dynamics. Extensive evaluation across several configurations demonstrates that our methods enable clients to effectively detect active GIAs without any modifications to the FL training protocol.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10504v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10504v1)

**摘要**:

Normalization is a key point in transformer training . In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.

**arXiv**: [2511.10507v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10507v1)

**摘要**:

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.

**arXiv**: [2511.10515v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10515v1)

**摘要**:

Olympiad-level physics problem-solving presents a significant challenge for both humans and artificial intelligence (AI), as it requires a sophisticated integration of precise calculation, abstract reasoning, and a fundamental grasp of physical principles. The Chinese Physics Olympiad (CPhO), renowned for its complexity and depth, serves as an ideal and rigorous testbed for these advanced capabilities. In this paper, we introduce LOCA-R (LOgical Chain Augmentation for Reasoning), an improved version of the LOCA framework adapted for complex reasoning, and apply it to the CPhO 2025 theory examination. LOCA-R achieves a near-perfect score of 313 out of 320 points, solidly surpassing the highest-scoring human competitor and significantly outperforming all baseline methods.

## 486. SemanticVLA: Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation

**作者**: Wei Li, Renshan Zhang, Rui Shao, Zhijian Fang, Kaiwen Zhou, Zhuotao Tian, Liqiang Nie

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10518v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10518v1)

**摘要**:

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA

## 487. Say It Differently: Linguistic Styles as Jailbreak Vectors

**作者**: Srikant Panda, Avinash Rai

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10519v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10519v1)

**摘要**:

Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

## 488. Convomem Benchmark: Why Your First 150 Conversations Don't Need RAG

**作者**: Egor Pakhomov, Erik Nijkamp, Caiming Xiong

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10523v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10523v1)

**摘要**:

We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10524v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10524v1)

**摘要**:

Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how research is conceived, conducted, and communicated across fields from chemistry to biomedicine. This commentary examines how AI is transforming the research workflow. AI systems now help researchers manage the information deluge, filtering the literature, surfacing cross-disciplinary links for ideas and collaborations, generating hypotheses, and designing and executing experiments. These developments mark a shift from AI as a mere computational tool to AI as an active collaborator in science. Yet this transformation demands thoughtful integration and governance. We argue that at this time AI must augment but not replace human judgment in academic workflows such as peer review, ethical evaluation, and validation of results. This paper calls for the deliberate adoption of AI within the scientific practice through policies that promote transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.

## 490. Evaluation of Grid-based Uncertainty Propagation for Collaborative Self-Calibration in Indoor Positioning Systems

**作者**: Andrea Jung, Paul Schwarzbach, Oliver Michler

**期刊**: arXiv [eess.SP]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10526v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10526v1)

**摘要**:

Radio-based localization systems conventionally require stationary reference points (e.g. anchors) with precisely surveyed positions, making deployment time-consuming and costly. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of collaborative self-calibration for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) networks, extending a discrete Bayesian approach based on grid-based uncertainty propagation. The enhanced algorithm reduces measurement availability requirements while maintaining positioning accuracy through probabilistic state estimation. We validate the approach using real-world data from controlled indoor UWB network experiments with 12 nodes in a static environment. Experimental evaluation demonstrates 0.28~m mean ranging error under line-of-sight conditions and 1.11~m overall ranging error across mixed propagation scenarios, achieving sub-meter positioning accuracy. Results demonstrate the algorithm's robustness to measurement noise and partial connectivity scenarios typical in industrial deployments. The findings contribute to automated UWB network initialization for indoor positioning applications, reducing infrastructure dependency compared to manual anchor calibration procedures.

## 491. Preview, Accept or Discard? A Predictive Low-Motion Interaction Paradigm

**作者**: Jose Berengueres

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.HC]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10532v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10532v1)

**摘要**:

Repetitive strain injury (RSI) affects roughly one in five computer users and remains largely unresolved despite decades of ergonomic mouse redesign. All such devices share a fundamental limitation: they still require fine-motor motion to operate. This work investigates whether predictive, AI-assisted input can reduce that motion by replacing physical pointing with ranked on-screen suggestions. To preserve user agency, we introduce Preview Accept Discard (PAD), a zero-click interaction paradigm that lets users preview predicted GUI targets, cycle through a small set of ranked alternatives, and accept or discard them via key-release timing. We evaluate PAD in two settings: a browser-based email client and a ISO 9241-9 keyboard-prediction task under varying top-3 accuracies. Across both studies, PAD substantially reduces hand motion relative to trackpad use while maintaining comparable task times with the trackpad only when accuracies are similar to those of the best spell-checkers.

**作者**: Wenqing Wang, Haosen Yang, Josef Kittler, Xiatian Zhu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10539v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10539v1)

**摘要**:

Reconstructing dynamic humans interacting with real-world environments from monocular videos is an important and challenging task. Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings. Extensive experiments on monocular video datasets demonstrate that StM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and rendering accuracy, particularly at challenging human-scene interaction boundaries.

## 493. Edge Machine Learning for Cluster Counting in Next-Generation Drift Chambers

**作者**: Deniz Yilmaz, Liangyu Wu, Julia Gonski

**期刊**: arXiv [physics.ins-det]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10540v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10540v1)

**摘要**:

Drift chambers have long been central to collider tracking, but future machines like a Higgs factory motivate higher granularity and cluster counting for particle ID, posing new data processing challenges. Machine learning (ML) at the "edge", or in cell-level readout, can dramatically reduce the off-detector data rate for high-granularity drift chambers by performing cluster counting at-source. We present machine learning algorithms for cluster counting in real-time readout of future drift chambers. These algorithms outperform traditional derivative-based techniques based on achievable pion-kaon separation. When synthesized to FPGA resources, they can achieve latencies consistent with real-time operation in a future Higgs factory scenario, thus advancing both R&D for future collider detectors as well as hardware-based ML for edge applications in high energy physics.

## 494. Two Americas of Well-Being: Divergent Rural-Urban Patterns of Life Satisfaction and Happiness from 2.6 B Social Media Posts

**作者**: Stefano Maria Iacus, Giuseppe Porro

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.SI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10542v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10542v1)

**摘要**:

Using 2.6 billion geolocated social-media posts (2014-2022) and a fine-tuned generative language model, we construct county-level indicators of life satisfaction and happiness for the United States. We document an apparent rural-urban paradox: rural counties express higher life satisfaction while urban counties exhibit greater happiness. We reconcile this by treating the two as distinct layers of subjective well-being, evaluative vs. hedonic, showing that each maps differently onto place, politics, and time. Republican-leaning areas appear more satisfied in evaluative terms, but partisan gaps in happiness largely flatten outside major metros, indicating context-dependent political effects. Temporal shocks dominate the hedonic layer: happiness falls sharply during 2020-2022, whereas life satisfaction moves more modestly. These patterns are robust across logistic and OLS specifications and align with well-being theory. Interpreted as associations for the population of social-media posts, the results show that large-scale, language-based indicators can resolve conflicting findings about the rural-urban divide by distinguishing the type of well-being expressed, offering a transparent, reproducible complement to traditional surveys.

## 495. Computing the Formal and Institutional Boundaries of Contemporary Genre and Literary Fiction

**作者**: Natasha Johnson

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10546v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10546v1)

**摘要**:

Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.

**arXiv**: [2511.10547v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10547v1)

**摘要**:

Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.
  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

## 497. URaG: Unified Retrieval and Generation in Multimodal LLMs for Efficient Long Document Understanding

**arXiv**: [2511.10552v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10552v1)

**摘要**:

Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.

## 498. A Style is Worth One Code: Unlocking Code-to-Style Image Generation with Discrete Style Space

**作者**: Huijie Liu, Shuhao Cui, Haoxiang Cao, Shuai Ma, Kai Wu, Guoliang Kang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10555v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10555v1)

**摘要**:

Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.

## 499. OmniVGGT: Omni-Modality Driven Visual Geometry Grounded

**作者**: Haosong Peng, Hao Li, Yalun Dai, Yushi Lan, Yihang Luo, Tianyu Qi, Zhengshen Zhang, Yufeng Zhan, Junfei Zhang, Wenchao Xu *et al.* (11 authors)

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10560v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10560v1)

**摘要**:

General 3D foundation models have started to lead the trend of unifying diverse vision tasks, yet most assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues (e.g., camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps). To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.

## 500. Maximizing Efficiency of Dataset Compression for Machine Learning Potentials With Information Theory

**作者**: Benjamin Yu, Vincenzo Lordi, Daniel Schwalbe-Koda

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10561v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10561v1)

**摘要**:

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.

**arXiv**: [2511.10562v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10562v1)

**摘要**:

Accurate precipitation estimation is critical for hydrological applications, especially in the Global South where ground-based observation networks are sparse and forecasting skill is limited. Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.

## 502. Impact of Layer Norm on Memorization and Generalization in Transformers

**作者**: Rishi Singhal, Jung-Eun Kim

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10566v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10566v1)

**摘要**:

Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

## 503. Belief Net: A Filter-Based Framework for Learning Hidden Markov Models from Observations

**作者**: Reginald Zhiyan Chen, Heng-Sheng Chang, Prashant G. Mehta

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10571v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10571v1)

**摘要**:

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.

## 504. Bi-Level Contextual Bandits for Individualized Resource Allocation under Delayed Feedback

**作者**: Mohammadsina Almasi, Hadis Anahideh

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10572v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10572v1)

**摘要**:

Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare.

## 505. Towards Emotionally Intelligent and Responsible Reinforcement Learning

**作者**: Garapati Keerthana, Manik Gupta

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10573v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10573v1)

**摘要**:

Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

**作者**: Fengsheng Lin, Shengyi Yan, Trac Duy Tran

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10575v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10575v1)

**摘要**:

We present a semi-unified sparse dictionary learning framework that bridges the gap between classical sparse models and modern deep architectures. Specifically, the method integrates strict Top-$K$ LISTA and its convex FISTA-based variant (LISTAConv) into the discriminative LC-KSVD2 model, enabling co-evolution between the sparse encoder and the dictionary under supervised or unsupervised regimes. This unified design retains the interpretability of traditional sparse coding while benefiting from efficient, differentiable training.
  We further establish a PALM-style convergence analysis for the convex variant, ensuring theoretical stability under block alternation. Experimentally, our method achieves 95.6\% on CIFAR-10, 86.3\% on CIFAR-100, and 88.5\% on TinyImageNet with faster convergence and lower memory cost ($<$4GB GPU). The results confirm that the proposed LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv pipeline offers an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for modern deep architectures.

## 507. Tight Robustness Certification through the Convex Hull of $\ell_0$ Attacks

**作者**: Yuval Shapira, Dana Drachsler-Cohen

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10576v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10576v1)

**摘要**:

Few-pixel attacks mislead a classifier by modifying a few pixels of an image. Their perturbation space is an $\ell_0$-ball, which is not convex, unlike $\ell_p$-balls for $p\geq1$. However, existing local robustness verifiers typically scale by relying on linear bound propagation, which captures convex perturbation spaces. We show that the convex hull of an $\ell_0$-ball is the intersection of its bounding box and an asymmetrically scaled $\ell_1$-like polytope. The volumes of the convex hull and this polytope are nearly equal as the input dimension increases. We then show a linear bound propagation that precisely computes bounds over the convex hull and is significantly tighter than bound propagations over the bounding box or our $\ell_1$-like polytope. This bound propagation scales the state-of-the-art $\ell_0$ verifier on its most challenging robustness benchmarks by 1.24x-7.07x, with a geometric mean of 3.16.

## 508. DESS: DeBERTa Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction

**作者**: Vishal Thenuwara, Nisansa de Silva

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**DOI**: [10.1007/978-3-032-09318-9_13](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-032-09318-9_13)

**摘要**:

Fine-grained sentiment analysis faces ongoing challenges in Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), particularly in accurately capturing the relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.

**arXiv**: [2511.10583v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10583v1)

**摘要**:

The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10585v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10585v1)

**摘要**:

The WikiRace game, where players navigate between Wikipedia articles using only hyperlinks, serves as a compelling benchmark for goal-directed search in complex information networks. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of navigation strategies for this task, comparing agents guided by graph-theoretic structure (betweenness centrality), semantic meaning (language model embeddings), and hybrid approaches. Through rigorous benchmarking on a large Wikipedia subgraph, we demonstrate that a purely greedy agent guided by the semantic similarity of article titles is overwhelmingly effective. This strategy, when combined with a simple loop-avoidance mechanism, achieved a perfect success rate and navigated the network with an efficiency an order of magnitude better than structural or hybrid methods. Our findings highlight the critical limitations of purely structural heuristics for goal-directed search and underscore the transformative potential of large language models to act as powerful, zero-shot semantic navigators in complex information spaces.

**作者**: Miles Wang-Henderson, Ben Kaufman, Edward Williams, Ryan Pederson, Matteo Rossi, Owen Howell, Carl Underkoffler, Narbe Mardirossian, John Parkhill

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10590v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10590v1)

**摘要**:

Batched synthesis and testing of molecular designs is the key bottleneck of drug development. There has been great interest in leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates to accelerate this process. In this work, we show how to obtain scalable probabilistic surrogates of binding affinity for use in Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO). This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO. Their utility is demonstrated by rediscovering known potent EGFR inhibitors on a semi-synthetic benchmark in up to 5x fewer iterations, as well as potent inhibitors from a real-world small-molecule library in up to 10x fewer iterations, offering a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10591v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10591v1)

**摘要**:

The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.

## 513. Regular Games -- an Automata-Based General Game Playing Language

**作者**: Radosław Miernik, Marek Szykuła, Jakub Kowalski, Jakub Cieśluk, Łukasz Galas, Wojciech Pawlik

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.AI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10593v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10593v1)

**摘要**:

We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) system called Regular Games (RG). The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.

## 514. The Resonance Principle: Empirical Evidence for Emergent Phase Synchronization in Human Causal Reasoning

**作者**: Ahmed Gamal Eldin

**期刊**: arXiv [eess.SY]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10596v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10596v1)

**摘要**:

Current artificial intelligence systems excel at correlational pattern matching but fail to achieve genuine causal understanding, a limitation often described as the "Kepler versus Newton" problem. We argue that this limitation is inherent to deterministic digital architectures. We introduce the Resonance Principle, a theoretical framework proposing that causal understanding emerges only in stochastic, bounded agents with intrinsic cost functions. The agent's substrate is modeled as a network of weakly coupled oscillators, where action proposals arise as stable resonant modes excited by intrinsic noise. We hypothesize that the brain, a stochastic and resonant system, operates according to this principle. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG data (25 recordings, 500 trials) from a P300 BCI task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization (resonance) and compared it to the Event-Related Potential (ERP) voltage. Global resonance and voltage were statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.048), yet trial-level analysis revealed a strong correlation (r = 0.590, p < 0.0001). This suggests that resonance is a hidden mechanism coordinating neural firing, giving rise to measurable ERPs. We conclude that phase synchronization is not a byproduct but a fundamental signature of emergent causal understanding.

## 515. From 2D to 3D Without Extra Baggage: Data-Efficient Cancer Detection in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis

**作者**: Yen Nhi Truong Vu, Dan Guo, Sripad Joshi, Harshit Kumar, Jason Su, Thomas Paul Matthews

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**arXiv**: [2511.10597v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10597v1)

**摘要**:

Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) enhances finding visibility for breast cancer detection by providing volumetric information that reduces the impact of overlapping tissues; however, limited annotated data has constrained the development of deep learning models for DBT. To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime. On the popular BCS-DBT benchmark, M&M-3D outperforms previous top baseline by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.

**arXiv**: [2511.10604v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10604v1)

**摘要**:

Although Sentinel-2 based land use and land cover (LULC) classification is critical for various environmental monitoring applications, it is a very difficult task due to some key data challenges (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, context information, signature ambiguity). This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.

**摘要**:

Internet measurement research faces an accessibility crisis: complex analyses require custom integration of multiple specialized tools that demands specialized domain expertise. When network disruptions occur, operators need rapid diagnostic workflows spanning infrastructure mapping, routing analysis, and dependency modeling. However, developing these workflows requires specialized knowledge and significant manual effort.
  We present ArachNet, the first system demonstrating that LLM agents can independently generate measurement workflows that mimics expert reasoning. Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated. ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation. We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions. Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination. ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process that experts use, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining the technical rigor required for research-quality analysis.

**arXiv**: [2511.10615v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10615v1)

**摘要**:

Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at understanding and generating video descriptions but their high memory, computation, and deployment demands hinder practical use particularly for blind and low-vision (BLV) users who depend on detailed, context-aware descriptions. To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.

## 519. Know Your Limits: Entropy Estimation Modeling for Compression and Generalization

**作者**: Benjamin L. Badger, Matthew Neligeorge

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10618v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10618v1)

**摘要**:

Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.

## 520. Algorithm Design and Stronger Guarantees for the Improving Multi-Armed Bandits Problem

**作者**: Avrim Blum, Marten Garicano, Kavya Ravichandran, Dravyansh Sharma

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10619v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10619v1)

**摘要**:

The improving multi-armed bandits problem is a formal model for allocating effort under uncertainty, motivated by scenarios such as investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves. Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.

**arXiv**: [2511.10621v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10621v1)

**摘要**:

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.

## 522. Global Solutions to Non-Convex Functional Constrained Problems with Hidden Convexity

**作者**: Ilyas Fatkhullin, Niao He, Guanghui Lan, Florian Wolf

**期刊**: arXiv [math.OC]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10626v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10626v1)

**摘要**:

Constrained non-convex optimization is fundamentally challenging, as global solutions are generally intractable and constraint qualifications may not hold. However, in many applications, including safe policy optimization in control and reinforcement learning, such problems possess hidden convexity, meaning they can be reformulated as convex programs via a nonlinear invertible transformation. Typically such transformations are implicit or unknown, making the direct link with the convex program impossible. On the other hand, (sub-)gradients with respect to the original variables are often accessible or can be easily estimated, which motivates algorithms that operate directly in the original (non-convex) problem space using standard (sub-)gradient oracles. In this work, we develop the first algorithms to provably solve such non-convex problems to global minima. First, using a modified inexact proximal point method, we establish global last-iterate convergence guarantees with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ oracle complexity in non-smooth setting. For smooth problems, we propose a new bundle-level type method based on linearly constrained quadratic subproblems, improving the oracle complexity to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-1})$. Surprisingly, despite non-convexity, our methodology does not require any constraint qualifications, can handle hidden convex equality constraints, and achieves complexities matching those for solving unconstrained hidden convex optimization.

**DOI**: [10.1007/978-3-031-93706-4_12](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-93706-4_12)

**摘要**:

Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.

**arXiv**: [2511.10628v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10628v1)

**摘要**:

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet the majority of high-performing models remain closed-source or partially open, limiting transparency and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries, Instella achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open models and is competitive with leading open-weight models of comparable size. We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.

## 525. One Small Step in Latent, One Giant Leap for Pixels: Fast Latent Upscale Adapter for Your Diffusion Models

**作者**: Aleksandr Razin, Danil Kazantsev, Ilya Makarov

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10629v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10629v1)

**摘要**:

Diffusion models struggle to scale beyond their training resolutions, as direct high-resolution sampling is slow and costly, while post-hoc image super-resolution (ISR) introduces artifacts and additional latency by operating after decoding. We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.RO]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10635v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10635v1)

**摘要**:

Despite recent advances in robust locomotion, bipedal robots operating in the real world remain at risk of falling. While most research focuses on preventing such events, we instead concentrate on the phenomenon of falling itself. Specifically, we aim to reduce physical damage to the robot while providing users with control over a robot's end pose. To this end, we propose a robot agnostic reward function that balances the achievement of a desired end pose with impact minimization and the protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To make the policy robust to a broad range of initial falling conditions and to enable the specification of an arbitrary and unseen end pose at inference time, we introduce a simulation-based sampling strategy of initial and end poses. Through simulated and real-world experiments, our work demonstrates that even bipedal robots can perform controlled, soft falls.

## 527. Black-Box On-Policy Distillation of Large Language Models

**作者**: Tianzhu Ye, Li Dong, Zewen Chi, Xun Wu, Shaohan Huang, Furu Wei

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10643v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10643v1)

**摘要**:

Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.

## 528. ParoQuant: Pairwise Rotation Quantization for Efficient Reasoning LLM Inference

**作者**: Yesheng Liang, Haisheng Chen, Song Han, Zhijian Liu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CL]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10645v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10645v1)

**摘要**:

Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) into low-precision representations to reduce memory footprint and accelerate inference. However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10647v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10647v1)

**摘要**:

We present Depth Anything 3 (DA3), a model that predicts spatially consistent geometry from an arbitrary number of visual inputs, with or without known camera poses. In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering. On this benchmark, DA3 sets a new state-of-the-art across all tasks, surpassing prior SOTA VGGT by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. Moreover, it outperforms DA2 in monocular depth estimation. All models are trained exclusively on public academic datasets.

## 530. Enhancing the Outcome Reward-based RL Training of MLLMs with Self-Consistency Sampling

**作者**: Jiahao Wang, Weiye Xu, Aijun Yang, Wengang Zhou, Lewei Lu, Houqiang Li, Xiaohua Wang, Jinguo Zhu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-13

**arXiv**: [2511.10648v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10648v1)

**摘要**:

Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is a common and increasingly significant way to refine the step-by-step reasoning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.

## 531. Improving Conditional VAE with approximation using Normalizing Flows

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.08946v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08946v2)

**摘要**:

Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

## 532. Convergence and Stability Analysis of Self-Consuming Generative Models with Heterogeneous Human Curation

**作者**: Hongru Zhao, Jinwen Fu, Tuan Pham

**期刊**: arXiv [stat.ML]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.09002v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09002v2)

**摘要**:

Self-consuming generative models have received significant attention over the last few years. In this paper, we study a self-consuming generative model with heterogeneous preferences that is a generalization of the model in Ferbach et al. (2024). The model is retrained round by round using real data and its previous-round synthetic outputs. The asymptotic behavior of the retraining dynamics is investigated across four regimes using different techniques including the nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory. Our analyses improve upon that of Ferbach et al. (2024) and provide convergence results in settings where the well-known Banach contraction mapping arguments do not apply. Stability and non-stability results regarding the retraining dynamics are also given.

**作者**: Muhammed El Mustaqeem Mazelan, Noor Hazlina Abdul, Nouar AlDahoul

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CR]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.09492v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09492v2)

**摘要**:

Password security plays a crucial role in cybersecurity, yet traditional password strength meters, which rely on static rules like character-type requirements, often fail. Such methods are easily bypassed by common password patterns (e.g., 'P@ssw0rd1!'), giving users a false sense of security. To address this, we implement and evaluate a password strength scoring system by comparing four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression with a dataset of over 660,000 real-world passwords. Our primary contribution is a novel hybrid feature engineering approach that captures nuanced vulnerabilities missed by standard metrics. We introduce features like leetspeak-normalized Shannon entropy to assess true randomness, pattern detection for keyboard walks and sequences, and character-level TF-IDF n-grams to identify frequently reused substrings from breached password datasets. our RF model achieved superior performance, achieving 99.12% accuracy on a held-out test set. Crucially, the interpretability of the Random Forest model allows for feature importance analysis, providing a clear pathway to developing security tools that offer specific, actionable feedback to users. This study bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and practical usability, resulting in a high-performance scoring system that not only reduces password-based vulnerabilities but also empowers users to make more informed security decisions.

## 534. Potent but Stealthy: Rethink Profile Pollution against Sequential Recommendation via Bi-level Constrained Reinforcement Paradigm

**作者**: Jiajie Su, Zihan Nan, Yunshan Ma, Xiaobo Xia, Xiaohua Feng, Weiming Liu, Xiaolin Zheng, Chaochao Chen

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.09392v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09392v2)

**摘要**:

Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

**arXiv**: [2511.09109v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09109v2)

**摘要**:

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios. Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

## 536. Learning-based Radio Link Failure Prediction Based on Measurement Dataset in Railway Environments

**作者**: Po-Heng Chou, Da-Chih Lin, Hung-Yu Wei, Walid Saad, Yu Tsao

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.NI]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.08851v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08851v2)

**摘要**:

In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.

**作者**: Lijun Zhang, Suyuan Liu, Siwei Wang, Shengju Yu, Xueling Zhu, Miaomiao Li, Xinwang Liu

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.09211v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09211v2)

**摘要**:

Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

**arXiv**: [2511.09147v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09147v2)

**摘要**:

Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2 $mm$ MPJPE and 112.6 $mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.09193v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09193v2)

**摘要**:

PIBT is a rule-based Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solver, widely used as a low-level planner or action sampler in many state-of-the-art approaches. Its primary advantage lies in its exceptional speed, enabling action selection for thousands of agents within milliseconds by considering only the immediate next timestep. However, this short-horizon design leads to poor performance in scenarios where agents have orientation and must perform time-consuming rotation actions. In this work, we present an enhanced version of PIBT that addresses this limitation by incorporating multi-action operations. We detail the modifications introduced to improve PIBT's performance while preserving its hallmark efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our method, when combined with graph-guidance technique and large neighborhood search optimization, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the online LMAPF-T setting.

## 540. LLM-Guided Probabilistic Fusion for Label-Efficient Document Layout Analysis

**作者**: Ibne Farabi Shihab, Sanjeda Akter, Anuj Sharma

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.08903v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08903v2)

**摘要**:

Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

**作者**: Tobias Eisenreich, Nicholas Friedlaender, Stefan Wagner

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.SE]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.09231v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09231v2)

**摘要**:

Use case modeling employs user-centered scenarios to outline system requirements. These help to achieve consensus among relevant stakeholders. Because the manual creation of use case models is demanding and time-consuming, it is often skipped in practice. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in this tedious process. The proposed method integrates an open-weight LLM to systematically extract actors and use cases from software requirements with advanced prompt engineering techniques. The method is evaluated using an exploratory study conducted with five professional software engineers, which compares traditional manual modeling to the proposed LLM-based approach. The results show a substantial acceleration, reducing the modeling time by 60\%. At the same time, the model quality remains on par. Besides improving the modeling efficiency, the participants indicated that the method provided valuable guidance in the process.

## 542. Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Ensemble Non-Attention

**作者**: Yipeng Zou, Qin Liu, Jie Wu, Yu Peng, Guo Chen, Hui Zhou, Guanghui Ye

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.08937v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08937v2)

**摘要**:

Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

## 543. Reduced-Complexity Model Selection and Rate Allocation for Multiple-Model Electrical Signal Compression

**作者**: Corentin Presvôts, Michel Kieffer, Thibault Prevost

**期刊**: arXiv [eess.SP]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.09370v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09370v2)

**摘要**:

This paper adapts a Multiple-Model Coding (MMC) approach for sampled electrical signal waveforms to satisfy reconstructed signal quality constraints. The baseline MMC approach consists of two stages processing vectors of Voltage and Current Signal (VCS) of constant size and producing bitstreams of constant rate but varying quality. In the proposed approach, the parametric model and the rate allocated to the first stage, as well as the residual compression method of the second stage and its associated rate, are jointly optimized to achieve a target distortion of the reconstructed signal. Three approaches are proposed. An exhaustive search serves as a baseline for comparison. Then, an approach involving a Golden Section search is exploited to determine the rate of the first stage with reduced complexity. Finally, rate-distortion models of the compression efficiency for each model in the first stage are employed to obtain a subset of promising models in the first stage and reduced-size search intervals for the rate selection in both stages. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reduced-complexity MMC approach reduces the rate for a given distortion constraint compared to state-of-the-art solutions for VCS with equivalent complexity.

## 544. vMFCoOp: Towards Equilibrium on a Unified Hyperspherical Manifold for Prompting Biomedical VLMs

**作者**: Minye Shao, Sihan Guo, Xinrun Li, Xingyu Miao, Haoran Duan, Yang Long

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.CV]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**arXiv**: [2511.09540v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09540v2)

**摘要**:

Recent advances in context optimization (CoOp) guided by large language model (LLM)-distilled medical semantic priors offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering and full fine-tuning for adapting biomedical CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs). However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work aims to continuously expand to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.

**arXiv**: [2511.09557v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09557v2)

**摘要**:

As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, distributed inference has become increasingly important. Model-parallel strategies must now efficiently scale not only across multiple GPUs but also across multiple nodes. In this work, we present a detailed performance study of multi-node distributed inference using LLMs on GPU-based supercomputers. We conduct experiments with several state-of-the-art inference engines alongside YALIS, a research-oriented prototype engine designed for controlled experimentation. We analyze the strong-scaling behavior of different model-parallel schemes and identify key bottlenecks. Since all-reduce operations are a common performance bottleneck, we develop NVRAR, a hierarchical all-reduce algorithm based on recursive doubling with NVSHMEM. NVRAR achieves up to 1.9x-3.6x lower latency than NCCL for message sizes between 128 KB and 2 MB on HPE Slingshot and InfiniBand interconnects. Integrated into YALIS, NVRAR achieves up to a 1.72x reduction in end-to-end batch latency for the Llama 3.1 405B model in multi-node decode-heavy workloads using tensor parallelism.

                    . Here we demonstrate a different mechanism of FAC assembly, diverse functions for the 14-3-3 proteins within the complex, and an unexpected spatiotemporal distribution of the FAC. We show that FT is not recruited by 14-3-3 alone, but that it interacts with the DNA–FD–14-3-3 complex through two interfaces, one of which binds DNA via the unstructured C terminus of FT. We also find that interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with the C terminus of phosphorylated FD reduces liquid phase condensation of the intrinsically disordered FD protein, allowing it to bind DNA, and that the 14-3-3 proteins strengthen DNA binding of FD by promoting dimerization, which ultimately results in the recruitment of FT. Unexpectedly, we also find that after FT movement to the shoot apex,
                    <jats:italic>FT</jats:italic>
                    and

                    are co-transcribed in young floral primordia, forming a boundary with the suppressed bract and allowing formation of the FAC during the first stages of floral development. Our studies propose a new mechanism by which the florigen FT transcriptional complex is formed, and indicate distinct functions for the complex during SAM and floral primordium development.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The 2022 European drought has underscored critical deficiencies in European water management. This paper explores these shortcomings and suggests a way forward for European drought risk management. In particular, we focus on four key aspects: the increasing drought risk, its spatial and temporal impacts, current management approaches, and how these differ across Europe. We base our findings on a continent-wide survey of water managers involved in responding to the 2022 drought. The survey collected 481 responses from 30 European countries and contained 19 questions on perceived sectorial impacts and the drought risk management practices implemented by the respondents' organizations. Information from the survey was supported with climate-related data on drought severity as quantified by the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, to offer a comprehensive overview of how extreme historical droughts are managed across Europe. Our findings reveal a consensus on the growing risk of drought, driven by droughts' rising frequency and intensity. While the 2022 event affected most of the continent, our findings show significant regional disparities in management capacity. In many countries – particularly those with agriculture-dominated economies – drought responses remain short-term and reactive, often leading to potentially maladaptive practices. Despite these challenges, we also observe a positive shift, with organizations showing increased awareness and preparedness. Hence, the lessons learnt from the 2022 event may provide an ideal opportunity to mainstream European-wide drought risk management. To seize this opportunity, we advocate for a European Drought Directive, to harmonize and enforce risk management policies across the continent. This directive should promote a systemic, integrated, and long-term risk management perspective. It should also set clear guidelines at the national and sub-national level, and for cross-boundary drought collaboration. This study and its companion paper, “From Crisis to Capacity: Institutional Preparedness and Response During the 2022 European Drought”, result from work carried out by the Drought in the Anthropocene network, an initiative of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS).

## 552. SynerCD: Synergistic Tri-Branch and Vision-Language Coupling for Remote Sensing Change Detection

**作者**: Yumei Tong, Panpan Zheng, Wenbin Tang, Shuli Cheng, Liejun Wang

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223694](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223694)

**摘要**:

RSCD faces persistent challenges in high-resolution imagery due to complex spatial structures, temporal heterogeneity, and semantic ambiguity. While deep learning methods have significantly advanced the field, most existing models still rely on static and homogeneous processing, treating all channels and modalities equally, which limits their capacity to capture fine-grained semantic shifts or adapt to region-dependent variations. To address these issues, we propose SynerCD, a unified Siamese encoder–decoder framework that introduces dynamic, content-adaptive perception through channel decoupling, frequency-domain enhancement, and vision-language collaboration. The encoder employs a Tri-branch Synergistic Coupling (TSC) module that dynamically rebalances channel responses and captures multi-scale spatial-frequency dependencies via Mamba-based long-sequence modeling and wavelet decomposition. The decoder integrates a vision-aware language-guided attention (VAL-Att) module, which adaptively modulates visual-textual fusion using CLIP-based semantic prompts to guide attention toward meaningful change regions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify that SynerCD achieves superior localization accuracy and semantic robustness, establishing a dynamic and adaptive paradigm for multimodal change detection.

## 554. Why Hydrological Memory Dominates in Low‐Latitude Highlands: A Mechanistic Shift in Ecosystem Response to Extremes

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Understanding how compound extremes affect terrestrial ecosystems is a major challenge in Earth system science. Although the combined effects of stressors are recognized, the manner in which the prestress state determines the basic response mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used the “natural experiment” methodology to compare two major extreme events within a monsoon‐influenced, low‐latitude highlands setting to explain mechanistic changes in land‐atmosphere interactions. By analyzing an extensive set of remote sensing and reanalysis data with nonlinear structural equation modeling, we show that the ecosystem response shifted from a traditional water‐limited paradigm during the 2010 drought to an energy‐governed paradigm during the 2019 heatwave. Our results suggest that this transition is governed by the antecedent root zone soil moisture status, which acts as a tipping point fundamentally shifting the impact of atmospheric factors on canopy evapotranspiration screens, such as temperature and vapor pressure deficit. This study highlights a possible threshold‐type state dependence non‐linearity, which is lacking in major Earth System Models. Incorporating this “hydrological memory” is crucial for minimizing uncertainties in climate projections and for correctly assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems in a warming world.

                    Southern Ocean eddies showcase complexity from both Eulerian and Lagrangian viewpoints, with the latter being more intricate largely due to the advection of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Through investigating the altimeter‐identified characteristics of the mesoscale eddy kinematic properties within the ACC axis, this study indicates that the eddies in the Southern Ocean are highly energetic with large kinematic properties, including amplitude, radius, and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). Notably, the derived interior EKE within the eddy boundary (EKE
                    <jats:sub>lo</jats:sub>
                    ) shows an increase, that is, an order of magnitude greater in the Lagrangian framework compared to the Eulerian one. The strong Lagrangian variations likely arise from the rapid intensification of eddy energy influenced by the mixing and dissipation dominated by ACC fronts. These findings advance our understanding of the intricate dynamics of ocean eddies and ocean energy forward cascades in the Southern Ocean.

## 556. Numerical simulation of magma-rock interaction at Krafla volcano using OpenFOAM software and a simplified thermal model

**期刊**: Solid Earth

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**DOI**: [10.5194/se-16-1307-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/se-16-1307-2025)

**摘要**:

Abstract. We present a 2D numerical modelling study aimed at exploring magma-rock interaction following the emplacement of a magmatic sill into cold shallow crust. An interface-tracking solver was developed, based on the open-source OpenFOAM package that enables simulation of heat and momentum transfer between magmas of different compositions, with contrasting densities, thermal properties, temperatures, crystal contents, and strain-rate dependent viscosities. Two scenarios are considered to reconstruct sharp temperature gradients and explain the presence of fresh rhyolitic fragments excavated from approximately 2 km depth during IDDP-1 drilling at Krafla caldera in 2009: partial melting of felsic crust triggered by either (1) a 300 m thick rhyolite intrusion or (2) a 100 m thick basalt sill. We also assume two possible magma emplacement periods, during the Krafla Fires (1975–1984, ∼ 35 years before drilling) and during the Myvatn Fires (1724–1729, ∼ 300 years before drilling). In Scenario (1), vigorously convective molten rhyolite produces a temperature jump (400 °C) over approximately 25 m (∼ 16 °C m−1) 35 years after emplacement. After 300 years, the thickness of these molten rocks reaches approximately 70 m, however, the thermal gradient becomes too small (less than 5 °C m−1) to explain the IDDP-1 observations. In Scenario (2), because of large density contrasts between the injected basaltic magma and molten rhyolite, two separate convective layers are formed. The thickness of molten rocks reaches about 40 m after 35 years, and the propagating melting front produces a sharp temperature gradient in the undisturbed rocks, greater than 26 °C m−1. These results together with previous petrological studies lead us to conclude that this second scenario of a basaltic intrusion provides a more robust explanation for the extreme geothermal gradient encountered in 2009 than the first scenario. By comparing with a simplified 1D thermal model and performing parametric tests, we argue that both 2D and 1D numerical approaches help constraining better magmatic convection at such extremely high Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers.

## 557. Inequality-constrained integer least-squares and its application to troposphere-bounded GNSS PPP

**作者**: Andreas Brack, Shengping He

**期刊**: GPS Solutions

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**DOI**: [10.1007/s10291-025-01991-w](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10291-025-01991-w)

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  In GNSS precise point positioning (PPP), a user commonly estimates a troposphere parameter representing the zenith wet delay (ZWD). The ZWD is non-negative and generally assumes values of up to around 30 cm. In the initial epochs of a PPP solution, however, the precision of the estimated ZWD parameter can be on the several meter level, most likely leading to unrealistic ZWD estimates outside of this interval, and large errors in the up component. In this contribution, we introduce and discuss a troposphere-bounded GNSS model, in which the ZWD parameter is constrained to an a-priori defined feasible interval. This translates to an observation model with linear inequality constraints, for which we derive and discuss two solutions, the constrained float solution and the constrained integer least-squares (ILS) solution. We analyze the positioning capabilities of the troposphere-bounded model as compared to the unconstrained case by means of simulated multi-frequency GPS and Galileo PPP examples and exemplary real-data experiments. With the constrained ambiguity-float solution, the RMS error of the up component is improved by up to 75% for GPS and up to 65% for GPS + Galileo solutions in the first observation epochs, even for relatively loose ZWD constraint intervals of 20 cm or more. The constrained ILS solution leads to higher ambiguity success rates, so that for instance ZWD constraint intervals of five and 20 cm reduce the average times-to-first-fix the ambiguities by around 17.5% and 10%.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Measuring the elemental composition of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) can provide useful information on the adverse effects of PM and facilitate the identification of emission sources. Carrying out these measurements at a high temporal resolution (1 h or less) allows describing the fast processes to which aerosol particles are subjected in the atmosphere, leading to a better characterization of the emissions. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectrometry is one of the most widespread techniques used to determine the elemental composition of PM. In recent years, new systems known as online XRF spectrometers have been developed to provide real-time measurements of the PM elemental concentration at a high temporal resolution. Among these advanced instruments, the Xact® 625i Ambient Metals Monitor by Cooper Environmental (USA) performs in situ automated measurements with a user-selected temporal resolution ranging from 15 to 240 min. In this study, an Xact® 625i monitor equipped with a PM10 inlet was deployed for nearly 6 months (July–December 2023) in Milan (Po Valley, Italy) at a monitoring station of the Lombardy Regional Agency for Environmental Protection (ARPA Lombardia). The instrument was configured to quantify 36 elements, ranging from Al to Bi, with 1 h temporal resolution in the PM10 fraction. The objective of the study was to verify the correct functioning of the instrument and to evaluate the quality and robustness of the data produced. Xact® 625i data were aggregated to 24 h daily means and then compared to 24 h PM10 filter data retrieved by ARPA Lombardia in the same station and analyzed offline for the elemental concentration with a benchtop ED-XRF spectrometer. The intercomparison focused on 16 elements (Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Sr, and Pb) whose concentrations were consistently above their minimum detection limits (MDLs) for both online and offline techniques. The results of the intercomparison were satisfying, showing that the Xact® 625i elemental concentrations were highly correlated to the offline ED-XRF analyses (R2 ranging from 0.67 to 0.99 and slopes ranging from 0.79 to 1.3, with only a few elements showing slopes up to 1.70).

                    Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a large genetic component
                    <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>
                    . It affects around 5% of children and 2.5% of adults
                    <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>
                    , and is associated with several severe outcomes
                    <jats:sup>3–11</jats:sup>
                    . Common genetic variants associated with the disorder have been identified
                    <jats:sup>12,13</jats:sup>
                    , but the role of rare variants in ADHD is mostly unknown. Here, by analysing rare coding variants in exome-sequencing data from 8,895 individuals with ADHD and 53,780 control individuals, we identify three genes (
                    <jats:italic>MAP1A</jats:italic>
                    ,
                    <jats:italic>ANO8</jats:italic>
                    and
                    <jats:italic>ANK2</jats:italic>

                    ; odds ratios 5.55–15.13) that are implicated in ADHD. The protein–protein interaction networks of these three genes were enriched for rare-variant risk genes of other neurodevelopmental disorders, and for genes involved in cytoskeleton organization, synapse function and RNA processing. Top associated rare-variant risk genes showed increased expression across pre- and postnatal brain developmental stages and in several neuronal cell types, including GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-producing) and dopaminergic neurons. Deleterious variants were associated with lower socioeconomic status and lower levels of education in individuals with ADHD, and a decrease of 2.25 intelligence quotient (IQ) points per rare deleterious variant in a sample of adults with ADHD (
                    <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
                     = 962). Individuals with ADHD and intellectual disability showed an increased load of rare variants overall, whereas other psychiatric comorbidities had an increased load only for specific gene sets associated with those comorbidities. This suggests that psychiatric comorbidity in ADHD is driven mainly by rare variants in specific genes, rather than by a general increased load across constrained genes.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Effectively reducing the risk of disasters in urban neighbourhoods is a key policy priority, which is becoming more pressing due to climate change. However, disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation efforts are often hampered by data gaps regarding the physical vulnerability and local impacts of hazards at the neighbourhood level. These gaps are particularly pronounced for informal settlements and marginalized communities of cities in the Global South, which are frequently invisible in official hazard and risk maps. Community-generated data and participatory methods are promising approaches to address these gaps, but there is a lack of guidelines and empirical examples of effective integration of communities into vulnerability assessment. This study presents the co-production of a physical vulnerability assessment framework, between academia, practitioners, and community researchers, using an iterative and easily replicable methodology. Working with community researchers from the self-constructed community El Pacífico in Medellín (Colombia), we developed a hazard perception exercise based on vulnerability indicators and produced hazard perception and physical vulnerability usable maps. We show how this work was able to refine the spatial scale of the hazard maps available for the neighbourhood, going beyond the city planning tools and enabling a building-scale vulnerability assessment that is valuable not only to support community decision-making and planning but also to advocate for public interventions towards reducing disaster risks.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  
                    Necroptosis is a form of lytic cell death that is overactivated during infections and in inflammatory pathologies
                    <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>
                    . NINJ1 was recently found to be a mediator of plasma membrane rupture (PMR) during pyroptosis, toxin-induced necrosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis
                    <jats:sup>2,3</jats:sup>
                    , but the mediator of PMR during necroptotic cell death remained unknown. Here, using a CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide knockout approach, we identify SIGLEC12 as a key mediator of necroptosis downstream of MLKL at the PMR step. Cells with knockdown or knockout of
                    <jats:italic>SIGLEC12</jats:italic>
                    are defective in necroptosis-induced PMR and demonstrate ballooning morphology. During necroptosis, SIGLEC12 undergoes dephosphorylation, interacts with MLKL, forms cytosolic puncta and assembles into fibrils. Notably, SIGLEC12 is cleaved by TMPRSS4 during necroptosis to produce a 20-kDa fragment highly homologous to NINJ1, and this cleavage event is required and sufficient to induce PMR during necroptosis. A SIGLEC12 variant associated with cancer (Ser458Phe) and a variant found in the general human population (Arg528Trp) attenuate SIGLEC12 cleavage by TMPRSS4. Knockout of
                    <jats:italic>Siglec12</jats:italic>
                    in mouse cells does not affect PMR, suggesting a species-specific role. Our identification of SIGLEC12 as a mediator of PMR expands our understanding of how programmed necrosis is executed and offers new approaches for targeting this proinflammatory form of cell death in human diseases.

                    , raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. We need to determine what is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-aligned behaviour. Here we highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions (for example, ref.
                    <jats:sup>5</jats:sup>
                    ), model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgements, then transfer human-aligned structure from its representations to refine the representations of pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models via fine-tuning. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behaviour and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a dataset of human judgements spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognitive judgements and more practically useful, paving the way towards more robust, interpretable and human-aligned artificial intelligence systems.

                    . These constitute a series of independent evolutionary experiments from which we can decipher the role of contingency versus convergence in the adaptation of animal genomes. Here we compare 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and their outgroups to reconstruct the protein-coding content of the ancestral genomes linked to 11 animal terrestrialization events, and to produce a timescale of terrestrialization. We uncover distinct patterns of gene gain and loss underlying each transition to land, but similar biological functions emerged recurrently pointing to specific adaptations as key to life on land. We show that semi-terrestrial species evolved convergent functional patterns, in contrast with fully terrestrial lineages that followed different paths to land. Our timeline supports three temporal windows of land colonization by animals during the last 487 million years, each associated with specific ecological contexts. Although each lineage exhibits distinct adaptations, there is strong evidence of convergent genome evolution across the animal kingdom suggesting that, in large part, adaptation to life on land is predictable, linking genes to ecosystems.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The role of firn structure and density in geodetic glacier mass balance estimation has been constrained, with studies in alpine conditions primarily relying on models. Our research focuses on understanding the firn structures, density, and accumulation history in the Grosser Aletschgletscher accumulation area, using field methods mainly involving ground-penetrating radar (GPR) as a geophysical tool and glaciological methods such as snow pits, snow cores, firn cores, and isotope analysis. We characterise the firn structure and determine the spatial firn density–depth profiles by estimating electromagnetic wave velocities using the GPR-based common mid-point (CMP) method. This is done by identifying reflection hyperbolae using semblance analysis of the CMP data set. Three density–depth profiles, up to 37 m depth, were obtained at various locations within the glacier accumulation area. The Ligtenberg (LIG) and Kuipers Munnekee (KM) firn compaction models were selected from the community firn models (CFMs) to evaluate how well the model results matched the observations. These models were predominantly adjusted to fit the estimated 1-D firn density profiles from CMP measurements by optimising model coefficients based on regional Alpine climatic conditions, rather than the conventional method of tuning to the firn core density profiles. Further, a method is introduced to estimate accumulation history by chronologically identifying GPR-derived internal reflection horizons (IRHs) as annual firn layers, by comparing the estimated snow water equivalent (SWE) within each IRH to SWE from long-term point mass balance measurements available at the accumulation area of the glacier. We investigated the spatial distribution of the firn density and the glacier's accumulation history over the past 10–14 years (2010–2023) using a 1.8 km GPR transect, supported by CMP-derived density–depth profiles. Furthermore, our findings emphasise the importance of direct measurements, such as snow cores, firn cores, and isotope samples, in identifying the previous end-of-summer horizon. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of integrating GPR, direct measurements, and firn compaction models to monitor firn structures and density, ultimately enhancing glacier mass balance estimation in future research.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Fast magnetosonic waves are electromagnetic waves with frequencies ranging from a few Hertz to several hundred Hertz, observed primarily near the magnetic equator. Recent studies demonstrate that magnetosonic waves can propagate into the  region, while their distributions and propagation properties there remain unclear. Using data from Van Allen Probes, we present the first systematic survey of magnetosonic waves' spatial distribution in the  region, revealing important characteristics of their propagation and evolution. The frequency spectra of magnetic power spectral densities reveal that under disturbed geomagnetic conditions, the bandwidth of fast magnetosonic waves shifts to higher frequencies, and the spectra exhibit a radial inner boundary and a low‐frequency boundary, both of which depend on geomagnetic conditions. These findings advance our understanding of the propagation and evolution of magnetosonic waves in the  region and their potential role in the inner magnetosphere.

                    Since late 2021, a panzootic of highly pathogenic H5N1 has devastated wild birds, agriculture and mammals. Here an analysis of 1,818 haemagglutinin sequences from wild birds, domestic birds and mammals reveals that the North American panzootic was driven by around nine introductions into the Atlantic and Pacific flyways, followed by rapid dissemination through wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, while non-canonical species acted as dead-end hosts. In contrast to the epizootic of 2015 (refs.
                    <jats:sup>1,2</jats:sup>
                    ), outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by around 46–113 independent introductions from wild birds that persisted for up to 6 months. Backyard birds were infected around 9 days earlier on average than commercial poultry, suggesting potential as early-warning signals for transmission upticks. We pinpoint wild birds as critical drivers of the epizootic, implying that enhanced surveillance in wild birds and strategies that reduce transmission at the wild–agriculture interface will be key for future tracking and outbreak prevention.

**摘要**:

Accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is crucial for geographical studies. However, mainstream segmentation methods, primarily based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), often fail to effectively capture edge features, leading to incomplete image feature representation and missing edge information. Moreover, existing approaches generally overlook the modeling of relationships between channel and spatial dimensions, restricting effective interactions and consequently limiting the comprehensiveness and diversity of feature representation. To address these issues, we propose an Edge-Fused Multidimensional Attention Network (EFMANet). Specifically, we employ the Sobel edge detection operator to obtain rich edge information and introduce an Edge Fusion Module (EFM) to fuse the downsampled features of the original and edge-detected images, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to represent edge features and surrounding pixels. Additionally, we propose a Multi-Dimensional Collaborative Fusion Attention (MCFA) Module to effectively model spatial and channel relationships through multi-dimensional feature fusion and integrate global and local information via an attention mechanism. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments on the Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS), as well as the Land Cover Domain Adaptation (LoveDA) dataset, demonstrate that our proposed EFMANet achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

**摘要**:

Variability across different calibration laboratories can impact the consistency of ocean color data; this study addresses that challenge through a coordinated comparison of spectral irradiance and radiance calibrations. As part of the Fiducial Reference Measurements for Satellite Ocean Color (FRM4SOC) Phase 2 project, the metrological consistency across six international laboratories was tested in the years 2022–2023. Each participant determined the responsivity for four transfer radiometers using their own SI-traceable radiometric standards and calibration procedures. This was among the first laboratory comparisons for Ocean Color Radiometry (OCR) using hyperspectral radiometers. The main objective was to verify that the instrument manufacturers and research laboratories can fulfill the updated International Ocean Color Coordination Group (IOCCG) protocols to perform SI traceable calibrations with an uncertainty of 1% (k = 1) for irradiance and slightly more for radiance. The comparison revealed biases among participants and provided an overview of the calibration capabilities of OCRs. The differences between the participants varied from ±1 … 2% up to ±5%. Biases due to different measurement conditions were corrected by the Pilot. Furthermore, biases due to traceability and different conditions revealed several data handling errors. However, after uniform data processing, the metrological compatibility between the participants was reached within ±3%.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The 2025  7.1 Dingri earthquake is a large normal‐faulting event within the Southern Tibet Rift System. We use space‐borne radar interferometry to investigate both coseismic rupture and ∼3‐month early afterslip. Results show that this event ruptured a west‐dipping (48°) fault, exhibiting a predominant normal dip‐slip of 4.7 m and a left‐lateral strike‐slip component of 3.2 m. Postseismic moment release ( 6.47) contributes 14.2% of the coseismic moment, predominantly (59%) from shallow afterslip (&lt;28 km; maximum 0.3 m) exceeding the contribution from deep afterslip (&lt;28 km; maximum 0.1 m). We find a depth‐dependent control on postseismic process: at 0–10 km, both 49% of aftershocks and substantial afterslip are driven by coseismic stress increases. Conversely, at 10–20 km depth, afterslip‐induced stress perturbations dominate, hosting 64% of aftershocks. The coseismic rupture kinematics reflect shallow crustal responses to deep tectonic processes, likely driven by the tearing of the Indian slab beneath southern Tibet.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Developing operational data assimilation systems for sea-ice models is challenging, especially using a variational approach due to the absence of adjoint models. NeXtSIM, a sea-ice model based on a brittle rheology paradigm, enables high-fidelity simulations of sea-ice dynamics at mesoscale resolution (∼10 km) but lacks an adjoint. By training a neural network as an Arctic-wide emulator for sea-ice thickness based on mesoscale simulations with neXtSIM, we gain access to an adjoint. Building on this emulator and its adjoint, we introduce a four-dimensional variational (4D–Var) data assimilation system to correct the emulator's bias and to better position the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Firstly, we perform twin experiments to demonstrate the capabilities of this 4D–Var system and to evaluate two approximations of the background covariance matrix. These twin experiments demonstrate that the assimilation improves the positioning of the MIZ and enhances the forecast quality, achieving an average reduction in sea-ice thickness root-mean-squared error of 0.8 m compared to the free run. Secondly, we assimilate real CS2SMOS satellite retrievals with this system. While the assimilation of these rather smooth retrievals amplifies the loss of small-scale information in our system, it effectively corrects the forecast bias. The forecasts of our 4D–Var system achieve a similar performance as the operational sea-ice forecasting system neXtSIM-F. These results pave the way to the use of deep learning-based emulators for 4D–Var systems to improve sea-ice modeling.

                    Crohn’s disease often presents with fistulae, abnormal tunnels that connect the intestine to the skin or other organs. Despite their profound effect on morbidity, the molecular basis of fistula formation remains unclear, largely owing to the challenge of capturing intact fistula tracts and their inherent heterogeneity
                    <jats:sup>1–3</jats:sup>
                    . Here we construct a subcellular-resolution spatial atlas of 68 intestinal fistulae spanning diverse anatomical locations. We describe fistula-associated epithelial, immune and stromal cell states, revealing abnormal zonation of growth factors and morphogens linked to establishment of tunnelling anatomy. We identify fistula-associated stromal (FAS) fibroblasts, which are assembled in concentric layers: a proliferative, lumen-adjacent zone beneath neutrophil and macrophage-rich granulation tissue, an active lesion core of FAS cells and a quiescent, pro-fibrotic outer zone. We examine the architecture of the extracellular matrix in the fistula tract and demonstrate that FAS populations associate with distinct collagen structures, exhibiting properties ranging from proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix remodelling to dense collagen deposition and fibrosis. We define niches supporting epithelialization of fistula tunnels and a FAS-like population that is detected at the base of ulcers in non-penetrating Crohn’s disease. Our study demonstrates that common molecular pathways and cellular niches underpin fistulae across intestinal locations, revealing the cellular protagonists of fistula establishment and persistence. This resource will inform the development of model systems and interventions to mitigate aberrant fibroblast activity while preserving their regenerative properties in Crohn’s disease.

**摘要**:

Abstract. We describe a new version of the Chicago Water Isotope Spectrometer (ChiWIS), designed for airborne measurements of vapor-phase water isotopologues in the dry upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) aboard research aircraft. This version of the instrument is a tunable diode laser (TDL), off-axis integrated cavity output spectrometer (OA-ICOS). The instrument was designed to measure the HDO / H2O ratio in the 2017 Asian Summer Monsoon flight aboard the M-55 Geophysica during the StratoClim campaign, and so far has also flown aboard the WB-57F in the 2021 and 2022 ACCLIP campaigns. The spectrometer scans absorption lines of both H2O and HDO near 2.647 µm wavelength in a single current sweep, and has an effective path length of 7.5 km under optimal conditions. The instrument utilizes a novel non-axially-symmetric optical component which increases the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 3. Ultra-polished, 4 in. (101.6 mm) diameter cavity mirrors suppress scattering losses, maximize mirror reflectivity, and yield optical fringing significantly below typical electrical noise levels. In laboratory conditions, the instrument has demonstrated a 5 s measurement precision of 3.6 ppbv and 82 pptv in H2O and HDO, respectively.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223693](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223693)

**摘要**:

Polarimetric radar offers strong potential for UAV detection, but time-varying polarization induced by rotor rotation leads to unstable echoes, degrading feature consistency and recognition accuracy. This paper proposes a unified framework that combines rotor phase compensation, adaptive polarization filtering, and a multi-branch polarization aware fusion network (MPAF-Net) to enhance micro-Doppler features. The compensation scheme improves harmonic visibility through rotation-angle-based phase alignment and polarization optimization, while MPAF-Net exploits complementary information across polarimetric channels for robust classification. The framework is validated on both simulated and measured UAV radar data under varying SNR conditions. Results show an average harmonic SNR gain of approximately 1.2 dB and substantial improvements in recognition accuracy: at 0 dB, the proposed method achieves 66.7% accuracy, about 10% higher than Pauli and Sinclair decompositions, and at 20 dB, it reaches 97.2%. These findings confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach for UAV identification in challenging radar environments.

## 592. Assessing the Consistency Among Three Mascon Solutions and COST-G-Based Grid Products for Characterizing Antarctic Ice Sheet Mass Change

**作者**: Qing Long, Xiaoli Su

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223699](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223699)

**摘要**:

To facilitate easy accessibility to the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) results for the geoscientific community, multiple institutions have successively developed mass anomaly grid products including mass concentration (mascon) grids; these were provided at the Gravity Information Service (GravIS) portal. However, an assessment of their consistency for studying large-scale mass redistribution and transport in Earth’s system is still not available. Here, we compare three major mascon solutions separately from the Center for Space Research (CSR), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and GravIS products based on the Combination Service for Time-variable Gravity fields (COST-G) by analyzing the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) mass changes in four aspects. Our results demonstrate that: (1) the four datasets exhibit strong consistency on the entire AIS mass change time series, with the largest difference occurring in the Antarctic Peninsula; (2) mass trend estimates show better agreement over longer periods and larger regions, but differences with a percentage of 20–40 exist during the late stage of GRACE and the whole GRACE-FO timespan; (3) notable discrepancies arise in the annual statistics of the Eastern AIS in 2016, leading to inconsistency on the sign of annual AIS mass change; (4) good agreement can be seen among these interannual mass variations over the AIS and its three subregions during 2003–2023, excluding the period from mid-2016 to mid-2018. These findings may provide key insights into improving algorithms for mascon solutions and grid products towards refining their applications in ice mass balance studies.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Sea spray aerosol (SSA) emissions are an important source of natural aerosol particles, in particular over the remote Arctic Ocean. However, measurement data on SSA fluxes in the Arctic are sparse, such that these fluxes remain poorly constrained in atmospheric models. Utilizing simultaneous particle and turbulence measurements onboard the novel platform T‐Bird, we quantitatively derive size‐resolved SSA flux densities (dry diameter range 222–3,525 nm), representing the first airborne study on aerosol particle fluxes in the Arctic. In the accumulation mode size range, the measurements suggest roughly 100% higher emissions than predicted by commonly used sea salt generating functions. Our results constitute important information to evaluate model results, especially for the future Arctic, in which the magnitude of SSA fluxes is projected to increase as the sea ice retreats.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223689](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223689)

**摘要**:

The scarcity of labeled hyperspectral video samples has motivated existing methods to leverage RGB-pretrained networks; however, many existing methods of hyperspectral object tracking (HOT) select only three representative spectral bands from hyperspectral images, leading to spectral information loss and weakened target discrimination. To address this issue, we propose the Band and Context Refinement Network (BCR-Net) for HOT. Firstly, we design a band importance learning module to partition hyperspectral images into multiple false-color images for pre-trained backbone network. Specifically, each hyperspectral band is expressed as a non-negative linear combination of other bands to form a correlation matrix. This correlation matrix is used to guide an importance ranking of the bands, enabling the grouping of bands into false-color images that supply informative spectral features for the multi-branch tracking framework. Furthermore, to exploit spectral–spatial relationships and contextual information, we design a Contextual Feature Refinement Module, which integrates multi-scale fusion and context-aware optimization to improve feature discrimination. Finally, to adaptively fuse multi-branch features according to band importance, we employ a correlation matrix-guided fusion strategy. Extensive experiments on two public hyperspectral video datasets show that BCR-Net achieves competitive performance compared with existing classical tracking methods.

## 597. Off-Nadir Satellite Image Scene Classification: Benchmark Dataset, Angle-Aware Active Domain Adaptation, and Angular Impact Analysis

**作者**: Feifei Peng, Mengchu Guo, Haoqing Hu, Tongtong Yan, Liangcun Jiang

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223697](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223697)

**摘要**:

Accurate remote sensing scene classification is essential for applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster management. In real-world scenarios, particularly during emergency response and disaster relief operations, acquiring nadir-view satellite images is often infeasible due to cloud cover, satellite scheduling constraints, or dynamic scene conditions. Instead, off-nadir images are frequently captured and can provide enhanced spatial understanding through angular perspectives. However, remote sensing scene classification has primarily relied on nadir-view satellite or airborne imagery, leaving off-nadir perspectives largely unexplored. This study addresses this gap by introducing Off-nadir-Scene10, the first controlled and comprehensive benchmark dataset specifically designed for off-nadir satellite image scene classification. The Off-nadir-Scene10 dataset contains 5200 images across 10 common scene categories captured at 26 different off-nadir angles. All images were collected under controlled single-day conditions, ensuring that viewing geometry was the sole variable and effectively minimizing confounding factors such as illumination, atmospheric conditions, seasonal changes, and sensor characteristics. To effectively leverage abundant nadir imagery for advancing off-nadir scene classification, we propose an angle-aware active domain adaptation method that incorporates geometric considerations into sample selection and model adaptation processes. The method strategically selects informative off-nadir samples while transferring discriminative knowledge from nadir to off-nadir domains. The experimental results show that the method achieves consistent accuracy improvements across three different training ratios: 20%, 50%, and 80%. The comprehensive angular impact analysis reveals that models trained on larger off-nadir angles generalize better to smaller angles than vice versa, indicating that exposure to stronger geometric distortions promotes the learning of view-invariant features. This asymmetric transferability primarily stems from geometric perspective effects, as temporal, atmospheric, and sensor-related variations were rigorously minimized through controlled single-day image acquisition. Category-specific analysis demonstrates that angle-sensitive classes, such as sparse residential areas, benefit significantly from off-nadir viewing observations. This study provides a controlled foundation and practical guidance for developing robust, geometry-aware off-nadir scene classification systems.

                    Artificial light pollution is increasing worldwide with pervasive effects on ecosystem structure and function, yet its influence on ecosystem metabolism remains largely unknown. Here we combine artificial light at night (ALAN) intensity metrics with eddy covariance observations across 86 sites in North America and Europe to show that ALAN indirectly decreases annual net ecosystem exchange by enhancing ecosystem respiration (

Our findings show that ALAN disrupts the fundamental energetic constraints on ecosystem metabolism, warranting the inclusion of light pollution in global change and carbon–climate feedback assessments.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Sedimentary rocks can provide information about the Earth paleoenvironment and are studied extensively to understand the causes and consequences of global climate changes in deep time. They facilitate long-time perspectives that constrain climate models and provide analogues for how Earth systems may respond to, and recover from, intervals of profound environmental change, including projected anthropogenic change. The Norwegian Svalbard archipelago offers an extensive Phanerozoic stratigraphic record that reflects the geological evolution of the northern flanks of continental assemblages that include Laurentia, Eurasia, and Pangea. Svalbard's Phanerozoic sedimentary and paleoclimatic archive is controlled largely by Svalbard's overall northward plate-tectonic motion from equatorial to high latitudes but also by regional to local formation of topography and basins in response to long-term plate reorganization, as well as the near- and far-field influence of large igneous province activity on the tectono-stratigraphic and paleoclimatic development. Various sedimentary and geochemical proxies, such as bentonite beds and carbon isotope excursions associated with the far-reaching environmental effects of the Siberian Traps, the High Arctic Large Igneous Province, and the North Atlantic Igneous Province, are present in Svalbard's near complete geological record. As such, Svalbard is unique in that these and numerous other global environmental perturbations are recorded within a relatively restricted study area, with most of the key events preserved and recorded in easily accessible drill cores and well-exposed outcrop sections. Here we review deep-time paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate research in Svalbard by summarizing 148 peer-reviewed scientific articles. The review builds on the well-established tectono-stratigraphic and lithostratigraphic framework, as well as state-of-the art environmental reconstructions, to provide insights into the Earth system during the Phanerozoic northward drift of Svalbard and the many major biotic crises in the geological past. We focus on globally significant events including (i) the expansion of Devonian vegetation, (ii) the Carboniferous–Permian response to icehouse conditions during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA), (iii) the End-Permian Mass Extinction (EPME) and the subsequent Triassic recovery, the (iv) Carnian Pluvial Episode, (v) Jurassic–Early Cretaceous climate perturbations including the Volgian Isotopic Carbon Excursion (VOICE) and the Aptian Ocean Anoxic Event 1a (OAE1a), and (vi) the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). We present and synthesize existing core and outcrop data that preserve biological and geochemical proxies and climate-sensitive sedimentary facies that reflect environmental change in terrestrial and marine settings. Finally, we discuss the Phanerozoic climate recorded in Svalbard and its role in providing high-latitude calibration points for several global paleoclimate events to provide a higher-latitude perspective to complement the dominance of mid- and low-latitude locations and datasets in the literature.

These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium

## 608. Improving turbulent airflow direction measurements for fiber-optic distributed sensing using numerical simulations

**摘要**:

Abstract. This study investigates the impact of microstructure geometry on the thermal and turbulence responses of electrically heated fiber-optic (FO) cables under varying flow conditions and turbulence intensities for the purposes of sensing flow direction. The underlying measurement principle is the directionally sensitive heat loss from electrically heated FO cables with imprinted microstructures exposed to turbulent airflows resembling a long hot-wire anemometer. Using the COMSOL Multiphysics 6.0 finite-element software, this study explores a wider range of different configurations of filled-coned and hollow-coned microstructures of varying size compared to existing studies. The research identifies optimal combinations which maximize temperature differences (ΔT) across FO cables with cones pointing in opposite directions while balancing key design criteria such as sensitivity to wind speed and minimizing the FO-cables' PVC coverage. We demonstrate that FO cables with hollow-coned microstructures (radius = 24 mm, height = 24 mm, and spacing = 15 mm) outperform their filled-coned counterparts, maintaining ΔT values above 2 K across a broader range of wind speeds and turbulence intensities. Notably, the hollow-cone configuration sustains a temperature difference of up to 0.8 K at a 60° wind attack angle. The findings implicate substantial improvements for an optimized FO cable design in atmospheric boundary layer studies, enabling more accurate measurements of wind direction, distributed turbulent heat fluxes, and vertical wind speed perturbations using fiber-optic distributed sensing (FODS). Future work shall validate the findings under field conditions to assess the robustness and real-world applicability of the optimized design.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Climate models are essential tools for understanding and predicting precipitation variability, yet the parameterization of sub‐grid cloud and convection processes remain a major uncertainty source of precipitation simulations. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainties in the simulated precipitation variability over dry and wet regions of China based on a 40‐year parameter‐perturbed ensemble spanning 1975 to 2014. The dynamic and thermodynamic contributions of physical parameters to precipitation variability are quantified. The results demonstrate that precipitation variability is mainly attributed to the change in the thermodynamic component of precipitation in China. However, the uncertain range of the dynamic component is comparable with that of the thermodynamic component, particularly at interannual timescale. Parametric sensitivity analyses suggest that at interdecadal timescale, most of the uncertainty in precipitation variability arises from internal model stochasticity. At interannual timescale, nearly 50% of the uncertainty is contributed by the parameter related to convective precipitation evaporation. Stronger convective precipitation evaporation rate simultaneously increases the dynamic and thermodynamic components of precipitation, suggesting the responses in the two components are tightly interconnected. The increased evaporation rate suppresses local convective precipitation but, via increasing low‐level water vapor and promoting remote moisture transport, strongly enhances large‐scale precipitation, leading to a net increase in total precipitation in convergence zones over tropical and subtropical monsoon regions and then enhancing upward motion in turn. Compared to drier years, stronger convergence in wetter years is more favorable for the long‐range transport of moisture to mid‐high latitudes, thereby enhancing precipitation interannual variability in China.

## 610. Reviews and syntheses: Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM)-derived mercury contamination in agricultural systems: what we know and need to know

**摘要**:

Abstract. The escalating global demand for gold has fuelled the rapid expansion of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM), which has become the largest source of mercury (Hg) emissions worldwide. Here we synthesize current research on the pervasive contamination of agricultural systems by ASGM-derived Hg, identifying the key environmental pathways and subsequent risks to food security. Within these systems, Hg undergoes complex biogeochemical transformations, with the methylation of inorganic Hg into its highly neurotoxic form, methylmercury (MeHg), being a critical process. This is particularly pronounced in rice paddy systems, where microbial activity and favourable redox conditions facilitate Hg methylation, resulting in the bioaccumulation of MeHg in rice grains – a staple food for billions. However, this synthesis reveals that atmospheric uptake is important to total Hg loadings in rice, and more so in tissues of crops grown in unsaturated soils. Indeed, we stress the importance of assessing all potential uptake pathways of Hg in agricultural systems: foliar assimilation from air, uptake from soils/water (particularly MeHg in rice), direct deposition to surfaces, and consumption of contaminated crop tissues (by both humans and livestock/poultry), to delineate the source and ratios of the different pools of Hg within crops and their consumers. A common shortcoming in past studies of ASGM-derived Hg in agricultural systems is that they have commonly overlooked one or more of these uptake pathways. These findings underscore a significant threat to global food chains and human health through the consumption of Hg contaminated produce. Mitigating these risks requires an improved understanding of the quantity of emissions/releases from ASGM, input pathways, and Hg biogeochemical cycling and fate in agricultural landscapes, paving the way for targeted interventions and sustainable management strategies to protect vulnerable communities. We suggest that these goals can be achieved through strategic international and interdisciplinary collaborations, novel and accessible technologies, and care for the dissemination of scientific information to impacted communities.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223696](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223696)

**摘要**:

Many multi-target tracking applications (e.g., tracking multiple targets with LiDAR or millimeter-wave radar) are challenged by closely spaced targets. In this work, we propose a method for the tracking of multiple extended targets or unresolvable group targets in such scenarios. The approach builds on the cardinality probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filtering framework for computational efficiency, models the target’s extent with the multiplicative error model (MEM), and uses variational Gaussian mixture model (VGMM)-derived responsibilities to drive probabilistic data association (PDA) measurement updates. This effectively mitigates state fusion between closely spaced targets and yields more accurate state estimation. In experiments on diverse simulated and real datasets, the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving the lowest localization, shape estimation, and cardinality estimation errors while maintaining an acceptable runtime and scalability.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  For future lunar exploration missions, In Situ Resource Utilisation (ISRU) is widely gaining attention. It refers to the creation of products by using natural resources locally available at the mission destination to sustain long-duration space missions while reducing risk and cost. With this aim, a key resource is represented by lunar regolith since it contains crucial components for supporting human life, propellant production, and the construction of habitats, tools, and other infrastructures. For the development of lunar ISRU technology, regolith samples returned during past missions (i.e., Apollo, Luna, and Chang’E programs) are key to informing technology requirements. Therefore, it is crucial to understand whether returned samples accurately reflect the physicochemical properties of the lunar regolith environment (i.e., being representative samples) and, subsequently, how representative regolith sampling processes could be implemented to minimize potential biases in the collected samples. The present paper reviews the working principles of geological sampling technologies used during past lunar missions to collect currently available regolith samples. In this context, errors and biases related to the different sampling methods are detailed based on the different elements of a sampling methodology. In addition, novel approaches recently proposed for lunar regolith collection are reviewed in terms of working principles, sampling performance and errors/biases potentially encountered during operation. Evaluated sampling systems consider both surface and subsurface regolith applications and include drills, diggers, bioinspired devices, pneumatic and non-pneumatic systems, to provide guidelines supporting the development of representative sampling systems while maintaining light-weight structures, low actuation system and energy requirements.

## 616. Post-Fire Streamflow Prediction: Remote Sensing Insights from Landsat and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle

**作者**: Bibek Acharya, Michael E. Barber

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223690](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223690)

**摘要**:

Wildfire-induced disturbances to soil and vegetation can significantly impact streamflows for years, depending upon the degree of burn severity. Accurately predicting the effects of wildfire on streamflow at the watershed scale is essential for effective water budget management. This study presents a novel approach to generating a burn severity map on a small scale by integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal imagery with Landsat-derived Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and upscaling burned severity to the entire burned area. The approach was applied to the Thompson Ridge Fire perimeter, and the upscaled UAV-Landsat-based burn severity map achieved an overall accuracy of ~73% and a kappa coefficient of ~0.62 when compared with the Burned Area Emergency Response’s (BAER) fire product as a reference map, indicating moderate accuracy. We then tested the transferability of burn severity information to a Beaver River watershed by applying Random Forest models. Predictors included topography, spectral bands, vegetation indices, fuel, land cover, fire information, and soil properties. We calibrated and validated the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) against observed streamflow and Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) data within the Beaver River watershed and measured model performance using Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Percent Bias (PBIAS) metrics. We adjusted soil (maximum infiltration rate) and vegetation (fractional vegetation cover, snow interception efficiency, and leaf area index) parameters for the post-fire model setup and simulated streamflow for the post-fire years without vegetation regrowth. Streamflow simulations using the upscaled and transferred UAV-Landsat burn severity map and the Burned Area Emergency Response’s (BAER) fire product produced similar post-fire hydrologic responses, with annual average flows increasing under both approaches and the UAV-Landsat-based simulation yielding slightly lower values, by less than 6% compared to the BAER-based simulation. Our results demonstrate that the UAV-satellite integration method offers a cost- and time-effective method for generating a burn severity map, and when combined with the transferability method and hydrologic modeling, it provides a practical framework for predicting post-fire streamflow in both burned and unburned watersheds.

                    Due to the COVID‐19 pandemic and changes in technology and energy consumption, recent years saw substantial variations in air pollution emissions, highlighting the importance of timely emission updates. In the United States, the level of surface ozone in many regions is close to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, making it important to understand even small changes in emissions. Subsequently, model simulations of ozone are less tolerant of uncertainties in emission estimation, such as those caused by outdated emission updates. Here, we propose and assess four emission refresh methods: state‐level emission adjustment (ADJ), ADJ with budget‐aware urban adjustment (BA), ADJ with TROPOMI‐derived city emissions (SatNOx), and an approach with a machine learning product generated by Variational AutoEncorder (VAE). The observed temporal trends from ground measurements Air Quality System (AQS) and TROPOMI products are employed to provide updates of anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NO

Comparisons of the ozone forecasts using the base and refreshed emission inputs show that the emission adjustments have reduced model mean biases by 19%–21% and enhanced the model's capability to forecast O

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  In this work, we report the simultaneous emergence of the X‐pattern of equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) in the American and Asian sectors during a geomagnetically quiet day for the first time through the Global‐scale Observations of the Limb and Disk and Global Ionosphere Specification data assimilation products. The Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) flying over the X‐pattern shows that vertical ion drift is downward around the cross and upward on both sides, along with the simultaneously observed neutral winds. The morphology of the EIA‐X is successfully reproduced by the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model‐Xtended with the constraint lower atmosphere (SD‐WACCMX). The mechanism behind the simultaneous EIA‐X is further clarified. We find that the EIA‐X cross coincides with the amplitude peaks of zonal neutral winds associated with the diurnal tide, and is primarily driven by downward ion drift resulting from the E‐region dynamo modulated by these zonal winds.

## 627. Multitemporal analysis of Sentinel-1 backscatter during snowmelt using high-resolution field measurements and radiative transfer modelling

**期刊**: The Cryosphere

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**DOI**: [10.5194/tc-19-5579-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-19-5579-2025)

**摘要**:

Abstract. The spatiotemporal evolution of snowmelt is fundamental for water resources management and risk mitigation in mountain catchments. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by satellite systems such as Sentinel-1 (S1) are promising for monitoring wet snow due to their high sensitivity to liquid water content (LWC) and ability to provide spatially distributed data at a high temporal resolution. While recent studies have linked multitemporal S1 backscatter to snowmelt phases, a correlation with detailed snowpack properties is still missing. To address this, we collected the first dataset of comprehensive wet-snow properties tailored for SAR applications over two consecutive snow seasons at the Weissfluhjoch field site near Davos, Switzerland. First, we tested previous methods which use multitemporal S1 backscatter to characterize melting phases and demonstrated that the observed monotonous increase in backscatter following the local minimum is due to the development of surface roughness. Then, we used the measured snow properties as input to the Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer (SMRT) model to reproduce S1 backscatter signals. Our simulations showed that rather than melting phases, time series of backscatter identify regimes dominated by either LWC, early in the season, or surface roughness, later on. The results also highlight several key challenges for reconciling S1 signals with radiative transfer simulations of wet snow: (i) the discrepancy in spatiotemporal variability of LWC as seen by the satellite and validation measurements, (ii) the lack of fully validated permittivity, microstructure and roughness models for wet snow in the C-band, and (iii) the difficulty of capturing wet-snow features potentially generating stronger scattering effects on a large scale – such as internal snowpack structures, soil features in case of low LWC and surface roughness – which are not necessarily captured by pointwise measurements.

## 628. Sensitivity Differences Between 118 GHz and 183 GHz Radiance in All‐Sky Assimilation With Hydrometeor Control Variables and the Impact on a Typhoon Structure Forecast

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  All‐sky microwave radiance assimilation plays a crucial role in numerical weather prediction, with the 183 GHz absorption band recognized for its strong sensitivity to humidity and clouds, and the 118 GHz absorption band primarily responsive to temperature but also sensitive to hydrometeors. The Microwave Humidity Sounder‐II (MWHS‐II) aboard the FengYun‐3 satellite includes channels near both bands, offering complementary capabilities. Although the assimilation performances of instrument channels in these bands have been studied, their comparative impacts on hydrometeor fields remain insufficiently explored. Through the separate and joint assimilation of 118 and 183 GHz MWHS‐II channels using hydrometeor control variables, this study investigates how directly adjusting hydrometeor analysis for thermodynamic consistency influences the analysis and forecasting of Typhoon Lekima (2019). Results show that the 183 GHz band has higher sensitivity to solid hydrometeors at higher levels, whereas the 118 GHz band is more sensitive to liquid hydrometeors at lower levels. These differences are clearly manifested in the hydrometeor analysis. Joint assimilation of both sets of channels improves the representation of temperature, humidity, and hydrometeor distribution. This not only enhances the analysis and forecasting of typhoon intensity but also deepens the understanding of typhoon structure. In particular, the sensitivity of the 183 GHz band to solid hydrometeors provides valuable insights into their role in the secondary eyewall formation for Typhoon Lekima (2019). With the use of hydrometeor control variables, the synergistic assimilation of MWHS‐II channels demonstrates potential for advancing tropical cyclone analysis, forecasting, and understanding of dynamics.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The Mediterranean Basin is regularly affected by atmospheric dust transport from the Saharan desert. These recurring events have strong implications for the Earth’s energy budget, cloud formation processes, human health, and solar energy production. Monte Cimone, with 2165 m a.s.l., is an ideal platform to investigate dust outbreaks in Mediterranean Europe. In this study, we present 21 years (2003–2023) of dust transport event identification, derived from continuous measurements of the aerosol optical size distribution coupled with backward trajectories. Throughout all the years investigated, the fraction of dust transport days remained constant at values between 15 % and 20 % without any detectable trend. This absent trend was also observed in the particulate matter concentration. The annual cycle of dust transport days was characterized by two peaks from May to August and in October and November with values up to 20 %. A similar annual cycle was reflected in the particulate matter concentration with the highest concentrations in summer and the lowest in winter. Grouping consecutive dust transport days into dust transport events revealed that in the winter months a typical event had a duration of one or two days, whereas in the summer months dust transport events lasted longer (three or more days). The 21 years of measurements presented in this study will set a baseline to assess future dust transport scenarios. Furthermore, they can be used to validate dust forecast models to increase the accuracy of predicting atmospheric dust transport towards the Mediterranean Basin.

**摘要**:

Abstract. We integrate the refactored community Noah-MP version 5.0 model with the NASA Land Information System (LIS) version 7.5.2 to streamline the synchronization, development, and maintenance of Noah-MP within LIS and to enhance their interoperability and applicability. We evaluate and compare 5-year (2018–2022) global and regional benchmark simulations of LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 and LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 for a set of key land surface variables. Both models capture the spatial and seasonal distributions of observed soil moisture, latent heat (LH), snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, snow cover, and surface albedo, with similar bias patterns. Both models tend to underestimate soil moisture over wet soil regimes and overestimate over dry soil regimes, with slightly higher (≤ ∼ 0.01 m3 m−3 for global mean) soil moisture in LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 than LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 across most regions. The model bias patterns of LH overall follow those of soil moisture, while LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 has a lower LH across many non-polar regions than LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1, which reduces the global mean LH bias from 0.99 to −0.39 W m−2. The model SWE bias patterns are dominated by the precipitation and temperature forcing uncertainties, with slightly lower SWE values in LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 (global mean bias of −13.2 mm) than LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 (global mean bias of −10.1 mm). The model bias patterns of snow depth generally follow those of SWE. LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 consistently overestimates snow cover globally with a mean bias of 0.11, while LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 effectively reduces the overestimates across the global snowpacks with a mean bias of 0.07 because of updated snow cover parameters. Both models show widespread overestimates of surface albedo over mid-latitude and high-latitude regions but significant underestimates in the Sahara Desert and Antarctica. Overall, LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 outperforms or is similar to LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 in the evaluated land surface variables, except for slight degradation in simulated surface soil moisture and SWE. This study reveals possible model deficiencies, motivates future improvements in coupled canopy-snowpack-soil processes and input soil data, and points to the importance of considering observational and forcing data uncertainties in model evaluation.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Estimates of surface ocean temperatures in the past are essential for evaluating the sensitivity of Earth's surface temperature to higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations such as those characterizing the Miocene. However, in the higher latitude regions, many proxy-based temperature estimates suggest extreme warmth, which imply much lower latitudinal temperature gradients than can be simulated by most coupled general circulation climate models under enhanced greenhouse gas forcing. This discrepancy implies either systematic biases in temperature proxy interpretation or the absence of key feedback processes in models. Here, we use a new approach to estimate high southern latitude surface ocean temperatures using clumped isotope thermometry in coccoliths – calcite plates precipitated in the surface ocean by the calcifying phytoplankton group coccolithophores. We present new determinations of the clumped isotope ratio in well-preserved coccoliths spanning the last 15 million years, extracted and purified from a sediment core located just south of the modern subtropical front (Ocean Drilling Program Site 1088, 41° S). Coccolith clumped isotopes reveal a 10 °C decline in temperatures at this location over the last 15 million years, and over the last 11 Ma of overlapping records the magnitude of cooling is similar to that estimated from the degree of undersaturation of alkenone biomarkers. However, the temperatures derived from coccolith clumped isotopes are 8–12 °C cooler than those estimated from alkenones, even though both are biosynthesised by the same organisms and therefore must reflect an identical production depth and season. This implies that some of the model-proxy mismatch may be due to unresolved issues in proxy interpretation. We propose that at this site, calibration biases lead to alkenone sea surface temperature estimates up to 5 °C too warm, whereas coccoliths reflect temperatures at the production depth which is several degrees cooler than the sea surface. The influence of secondary diagenetic carbonate precipitation at the seafloor is constrained to contribute a cold bias of 2 °C or less on the clumped isotope temperature for most samples.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols coupled with a Chemical Ionization Mass spectrometer (FIGAERO-CIMS) is a widely used method for determining the chemical composition of the molecular constituents of atmospheric organic aerosols (OA). This temperature-programmed desorption technique thermally desorbs OA in a linearly ramped desorption temperature, and the temperature at a detected molecule's peak desorption rate, Tmax⁡, is proportional to the molecule's volatility. Thereby, FIGAERO-CIMS also enables a direct measurement of the volatilities (saturation vapor pressures) of the OA constituents. A series of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) has been used to quantitatively connect FIGAERO measurement results (in particular, Tmax⁡) to volatilities (i.e., calibrate). However, available literature values of saturation pressure (Psat) or saturation mass concentration (C*) for these compounds only extend to PEG 9, which exhibits Tmax⁡ values around ∼ 90 °C, whereas Tmax⁡ values of OA constituents measured from lab-generated or ambient aerosols routinely reach up to 160 °C (Li et al., 2021; Masoud et al., 2022). To extend the region over which we can conveniently calibrate FIGAERO-CIMS, and hypothetically also other thermal desorption-based techniques for investigating OA composition and volatilities, we performed FIGAERO-CIMS calibration experiments using aerosol particles consisting of PEGs 5-15, which yielded Tmax⁡ values of up to ∼ 150 °C. We then set out to estimate the hitherto unknown Psat (C*) values of PEGs 10-15 by utilizing a suite of different Psat estimation methods: both measurement-independent methods (quantum chemistry-based calculations, molecular structure-based group contribution methods, and parametrizations based on molecular sum formulas) and fits of an explicit desorption model to our FIGAERO measurement results with C* and vaporization enthalpies as free parameters. We assess the respective suitability of each method and argue that we obtain the best estimates for PEG volatilities based on the fits to our measurements. We obtained log 10(C* (µg m−3)) values ranging from 0.51 ± 0.07 (PEG 6) to −9.2 ± 1.6 (PEG 14), agreeing with previous literature results on PEGs &lt; 10. Within uncertainties, our results broadly continue the near log-linear relationship of C* with PEG mass for larger PEGs and also agree with some of the independent methods. Contrary to common assumptions in previous literature on FIGAERO results, we find that the relationship between log⁡10(C*(µgm-3)) and measured Tmax⁡ is not linear. We explore the consequences of this finding on the analysis of previously published FIGAERO-CIMS measurements of sesquiterpene-derived OA. Prospects for improving on our results in future work are discussed. We conclude that calibration experiments using aerosol containing PEGs up to ∼ PEG 15, with best-estimated saturation vapor pressures, provide promising opportunities for constraining the volatilities of aerosol constituents, down throughout the range of extremely low-volatility organic compounds (ELVOC, C* &lt; 3 × 10−4 µg m−3), as detected not only via FIGAERO-CIMS but also other (online) temperature-programmed desorption techniques.

## 633. Impact of stratospheric intrusion on near-surface ozone over the Sichuan Basin in China driven by terrain forcing of Tibetan Plateau

**摘要**:

Abstract. Stratospheric ozone (O3) intrusion acts as a major natural source of tropospheric O3 affecting atmospheric environment. Targeting a stratospheric intrusion (SI) hotspot, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with the immediately adjoining O3 pollution region of Sichuan Basin (SCB) in Southwest China, this study assesses the contribution of SI to the near-surface O3 over SCB and reveals the multi-scale coupling mechanisms of atmospheric circulations with the seasonally discrepant terrain effects of the TP. Based on the simulations on four selected SI events in 2017, it is estimated that SI over the TP can penetrate deeply into the near-surface atmosphere in SCB, with event-specific maxima of up to 38.7 % in O3 increments, providing an extra contribution of 11.1 %–16.0 % to regional O3 pollution. The evolution of South Asian High in the upper troposphere with the peripheral subsidence in the warm seasons and the subtropical westerly jet over the TP in the cold seasons facilitates tropopause folding, driving stratospheric O3 into the free troposphere. We further identified the dominant processes for SI-derived O3 entering the near-surface layer over the basin with (1) a direct intrusion pathway of downward transport over the central and eastern SCB regions in the warm seasons, and (2) an indirect pathway of downslope transport along the TP-SCB slope into the western SCB region in the cold season, revealing the distinct seasonal effects of TP thermal and mechanical forcing on stratospheric O3 transport into the SCB region. These findings highlight the critical role of the TP in modulating stratosphere-to-troposphere O3 transport and its implications for regional air quality changes.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  We present Li lidar observations in the mesopause region above Kühlungsborn, Germany (54°N, 12°E). The lithium layer is mainly formed by meteoric ablation. But lithium has a much higher relative abundance in space debris compared with meteoroids, making it a good indicator of anthropogenic influence in the upper mesosphere. Our measurements reveal a strong seasonal increase in Li abundance between August and December 2024, growing from  to  . These values are in reasonable agreement with the first simulations based on the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM6) with a newly developed Li chemistry network; however, WACCM‐Li does not explain high Li abundances of up to   observed in January/February 2025. This may be due to anthropogenic effects or an unidentified natural mechanism. This study highlights the potential of lithium observations for monitoring the consequences of re‐entering space debris on the composition of the atmosphere.

## 638. Satellite Formation Flying Determination with Low-Cost GNSS Receivers Raw Data

**作者**: David Forero, Segundo Esteban, Oscar R. Polo

**期刊**: Remote Sensing

**发表日期**: 2025-11-12

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223691](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223691)

**摘要**:

Low-cost missions are ideal for applications that require spacecraft formation flying. The use of GNSS signals provides an economical solution to determine the orbital status of the formation. This paper facilitates the development of such missions by simulating spacecraft orbital formation conditions through the use of software-defined radio to generate the GNSS signals being received by each spacecraft. The simulation environment integrates low-cost commercial GNSSs, one for each member of the formation, to capture the signals generated. The analysis of the recorded raw signals shows that the instrumental error of the receivers is predominant because they have not been designed to work in orbital conditions. In addition to noise, the bias errors introduced must be taken into account by the mathematical trilateration methods, which can be very sensitive to these errors. This paper shows how sensitivity can be quantified using the condition number for matrix inversion. A condition number analysis determines that the optimal solution for trilaterating the orbital position of a spacecraft should use as few GNSS satellites as possible. The paper also introduces how to use the condition number to evaluate different methods for determining the state of the spacecraft formation: the independent trilateration method, the difference method, and the double difference method. The comparison of the methods shows that the difference and double difference methods are more sensitive to instrumental errors, because they are worse conditioned, but can be improved by reducing their order. Despite the limitations shown, at best, errors in the relative positions of the spacecrafts of the order of metres are obtained, demonstrating the feasibility of this type of mission and the usefulness of the condition number analysis method presented.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Mesoscale fractures, with lengths between meters and tens of meters, cannot be effectively characterized in the subsurface, due to limitations of borehole and geophysical datasets. On the other hand, large quantitative structural datasets can be collected on outcrops by combining direct observations and remote sensing (digital outcrop models – DOMs). These data can be used to constrain geometrical models of subsurface fracture networks with the outcrop analogue approach. In this contribution we present a workflow that leverages DOMs with at least two perpendicular faces and combines multiple types of input data (point cloud, textured surfaces and orthophoto DOMs), to collect a suite of statistical parameters to be used as input in current stochastic 3D DFN (Discrete Fracture Network) models. Orientation data are collected with a semi-automatic procedure applied to point cloud DOMs of the vertical side of the outcrop to extract 2D polygonal facets. Fracture sets are defined with a clustering procedure and different orientation distributions are fitted and tested with goodness-of-fit tests. Fracture traces are digitized on textured surface or orthophoto DOMs. Topological parameters are calculated on the digitized fracture network on horizontal and vertical orthomosaics, also considering relationships between fractures and bedding. Trace length and height distributions are estimated with an innovative approach, accounting for the censoring bias with survival/reliability analysis. P21 (ratio between total fracture length and sampling area) is measured from traces digitized on the large horizontal outcrop, also allowing for the Representative Elementary Area (REA) to be assessed. Even if the height/length ratio cannot be measured on an outcrop by any means, we attempt to relate heights and lengths under the assumption that the two datasets are correlated, with the longest fractures being also the tallest. We discuss the applicability of our workflow on a large high-quality fractured limestone outcrop in the Murge Plateau near Altamura (Puglia, Italy).

## 647. Stress drop sequences in the simplest pressure-sensitive ideal elasto-plastic media: implications for earthquake cycles

**DOI**: [10.5194/se-16-1335-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/se-16-1335-2025)

**摘要**:

Abstract. This study explores stress drops and earthquake sequences in the simplest pressure-sensitive elasto-plastic media using two-dimensional simulations, emphasizing the critical role of temporal and spatial resolution in accurately capturing stress evolution and strain localization during seismic cycles. Our analysis reveals that stress drops – triggered by plastic deformation once local stresses reach the yield criterion – resemble fault rupture mechanics, where accumulated strain energy is suddenly released, simulating earthquake-like behavior. Finer temporal and spatial discretization leads to sharper stress drops and lower minimum stress values, for simulations that have not converged yet. Displacement accumulates gradually during interseismic periods and intensifies during major stress drops, capturing key features of natural earthquake cycles. The histogram of stress drop amplitudes exhibits a non-Gaussian distribution. This “solid turbulence” behavior suggests that stress is redistributed across spatial and temporal scales, with implications for understanding the variability of stress drop magnitudes. Our results demonstrate that high-resolution elasto-plastic models can reproduce essential features of earthquake nucleation and stress drop behavior without relying on complex friction laws or velocity-dependent weakening mechanisms. These findings emphasize the necessity of incorporating plasticity into fault slip models to better understand the mechanisms of fault weakening and rupture. Furthermore, our work suggests that extending these models to three-dimensional fault systems and incorporating material heterogeneity and fluid interactions could offer deeper insights into seismic hazard assessment and earthquake mechanics.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223698](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223698)

**摘要**:

Wet-snow avalanches constitute a major geomorphic hazard in southeastern Tibet, where warm, humid climatic conditions and a steep, high-relief terrain generate failure mechanisms that are distinct from those in cold, dry snow environments. This study investigates the snowpack conditions underlying avalanche initiation in this region by integrating UAV-based multi-sensor surveys with field validation. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR), infrared thermography, and optical imaging were employed to characterize snow depth, stratigraphy, liquid water content (LWC), snow water equivalent (SWE), and surface temperature across an inaccessible avalanche channel. Calibration at representative wet-snow sites established an appropriate LWC inversion model and clarified the dielectric properties of avalanche-prone snow. Results revealed SWE up to 1092.98 mm and LWC exceeding 13.8%, well above the critical thresholds for wet-snow instability, alongside near-isothermal profiles and weak bonding at the snow–ground interface. Stratigraphic and UAV-based observations consistently showed poorly bonded, water-saturated snow layers with ice lenses. These findings provide new insights into the hydro-thermal controls of wet-snow avalanche release under monsoonal influence and demonstrate the value of UAV-based surveys for advancing the monitoring and early warning of snow-related hazards in high-relief mountain systems.

## 650. Predict-then-Optimize for Seaport Power-Logistics Scheduling: Generalization across Varying Tasks Stream

**作者**: Chuanqing Pu, Feilong Fan, Nengling Tai, Yan Xu, Wentao Huang, Honglin Wen

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-11

**arXiv**: [2511.07938v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07938v2)

**摘要**:

Power-logistics scheduling in modern seaports typically follow a predict-then-optimize pipeline. To enhance the decision quality of forecasts, decision-focused learning has been proposed, which aligns the training of forecasting models with downstream decision outcomes. However, this end-to-end design inherently restricts the value of forecasting models to only a specific task structure, and thus generalize poorly to evolving tasks induced by varying seaport vessel arrivals. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model across a varying tasks stream with a sustainable long-term computational burden. Experiments calibrated to the Jurong Port demonstrate superior decision performance and generalization over existing methods with reduced computational cost.

## 651. Towards Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Stabilization and Frequency Differencing

**作者**: Junkai Lu, Peng Chen, Chenjuan Guo, Yang Shu, Meng Wang, Bin Yang

**期刊**: arXiv [cs.LG]

**发表日期**: 2025-11-11

**arXiv**: [2511.08229v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08229v3)

**摘要**:

Time series forecasting is critical for decision-making across dynamic domains such as energy, finance, transportation, and cloud computing. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

## 652. Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression

**作者**: Cheng Yuan, Jiawei Shao, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li

**发表日期**: 2025-11-11

**arXiv**: [2511.08066v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066v3)

**摘要**:

Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

**arXiv**: [2511.07883v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07883v2)

**摘要**:

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising path toward energy-efficient speech command recognition (SCR) by leveraging their event-driven processing paradigm. However, existing SNN-based SCR methods often struggle to capture rich temporal dependencies and contextual information from speech due to limited temporal modeling and binary spike-based representations. To address these challenges, we first introduce the multi-view spiking temporal-aware self-attention (MSTASA) module, which combines effective spiking temporal-aware attention with a multi-view learning framework to model complementary temporal dependencies in speech commands. Building on MSTASA, we further propose SpikCommander, a fully spike-driven transformer architecture that integrates MSTASA with a spiking contextual refinement channel MLP (SCR-MLP) to jointly enhance temporal context modeling and channel-wise feature integration. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets: the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), and the Google Speech Commands V2 (GSC). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpikCommander consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN approaches with fewer parameters under comparable time steps, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency for robust speech command recognition.

**arXiv**: [2511.07994v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07994v2)

**摘要**:

Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.

Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets.This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought-augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.

## 656. Remodeling Semantic Relationships in Vision-Language Fine-Tuning

**摘要**:

Vision-language fine-tuning has emerged as an efficient paradigm for constructing multimodal foundation models. While textual context often highlights semantic relationships within an image, existing fine-tuning methods typically overlook this information when aligning vision and language, thus leading to suboptimal performance. Toward solving this problem, we propose a method that can improve multimodal alignment and fusion based on both semantics and relationships.Specifically, we first extract multilevel semantic features from different vision encoder to capture more visual cues of the relationships. Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation. We evaluate our proposed method on eight foundation models and two downstream tasks, visual question answering and image captioning, and show that it outperforms all existing methods.

**arXiv**: [2511.08655v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08655v2)

**摘要**:

The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

**arXiv**: [2511.08132v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08132v2)

**摘要**:

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect one in five adults over 60, yet more than half of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed. Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.

## 659. Investigating CoT Monitorability in Large Reasoning Models

**发表日期**: 2025-11-11

**arXiv**: [2511.08525v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08525v2)

**摘要**:

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers. Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models' misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.

**arXiv**: [2511.07925v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07925v2)

**摘要**:

Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, enabling voxelized 3D scene understanding for effective scene perception and decision-making. Existing SSC methods have shown efficacy in improving 3D scene representations, but suffer from the inherent input-output dimension gap and annotation-reality density gap, where the 2D planner view from input images with sparse annotated labels leads to inferior prediction of real-world dense occupancy with a 3D stereoscopic view. In light of this, we propose the corresponding High-Dimension High-Density Semantic Scene Completion (HD$^2$-SSC) framework with expanded pixel semantics and refined voxel occupancies. To bridge the dimension gap, a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module is designed to expand 2D image features along a pseudo third dimension, decoupling coarse pixel semantics from occlusions, and then identify focal regions with fine semantics to enrich image features. To mitigate the density gap, a High-density Occupancy Refinement module is devised with a "detect-and-refine" architecture to leverage contextual geometric and semantic structures for enhanced semantic density with the completion of missing voxels and correction of erroneous ones. Extensive experiments and analyses on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the effectiveness of our HD$^2$-SSC framework.

## 661. SOM Directions are Better than One: Multi-Directional Refusal Suppression in Language Models

**作者**: Giorgio Piras, Raffaele Mura, Fabio Brau, Luca Oneto, Fabio Roli, Battista Biggio

**发表日期**: 2025-11-11

**arXiv**: [2511.08379v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08379v2)

**摘要**:

Refusal refers to the functional behavior enabling safety-aligned language models to reject harmful or unethical prompts. Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.

**arXiv**: [2511.07871v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07871v2)

**摘要**:

Understanding human attitudes, preferences, and behaviors through social surveys is essential for academic research and policymaking. Yet traditional surveys face persistent challenges, including fixed-question formats, high costs, limited adaptability, and difficulties ensuring cross-cultural equivalence. While recent studies explore large language models (LLMs) to simulate survey responses, most are limited to structured questions, overlook the entire survey process, and risks under-representing marginalized groups due to training data biases. We introduce AlignSurvey, the first benchmark that systematically replicates and evaluates the full social survey pipeline using LLMs. It defines four tasks aligned with key survey stages: social role modeling, semi-structured interview modeling, attitude stance modeling and survey response modeling. It also provides task-specific evaluation metrics to assess alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness at both individual and group levels, with a focus on demographic diversity. To support AlignSurvey, we construct a multi-tiered dataset architecture: (i) the Social Foundation Corpus, a cross-national resource with 44K+ interview dialogues and 400K+ structured survey records; and (ii) a suite of Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets, including the expert-annotated AlignSurvey-Expert (ASE) and two nationally representative surveys for cross-cultural evaluation. We release the SurveyLM family, obtained through two-stage fine-tuning of open-source LLMs, and offer reference models for evaluating domain-specific alignment. All datasets, models, and tools are available at github and huggingface to support transparent and socially responsible research.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The ocean region off the Amazon shelf including the shelf break presents a hotspot for internal tide (IT) generation, yet its impact on phytoplankton distribution remains poorly understood. While previous studies have extensively examined the physical characteristics and dynamics of ITs, their biological implications – particularly in nutrient-limited environments – remain underexplored. To address this question, we analyzed a 26 d glider mission deployed over September–October 2021 sampling hydrographic and optical properties (chlorophyll a) at high resolution along an IT pathway as well as satellite chlorophyll a and altimetry data to assess mesoscale interactions. Chlorophyll a dynamics were analyzed under varying IT intensities, comparing strong (HT) and weak (LT) internal tide conditions. Results reveal that ITs drive vertical displacements of the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) from 15 to 45 m, accompanied by 50 % expansion in its thickness during HT events. This expansion is observed with a dilution of the chlorophyll a maximum concentration within the DCM depth. While direct turbulence measurements were not collected, the observed vertical redistribution of chlorophyll a is indicative of tidally driven cross-isopycnal exchanges, the only physical mechanism explaining the transfer of biomass above and below the DCM. At the surface, turbulent fluxes provide 38 % of the chlorophyll a input, while the remainder is supplied by in situ biological activity. Notably, total chlorophyll a in the water column increases by 14 %–29 % during high internal tide phases, indicating a net enhancement of primary productivity driven by the combined effects of vertical mixing and stimulated surface-layer biological activity. These findings indicate that internal tides can be an important driver of chlorophyll a distribution and short-term biological variability in our study region. By reshaping the vertical chlorophyll a profile through vertical mixing, active internal tides influence primary productivity and may contribute to carbon cycling, particularly in oligotrophic oceanic environments where both a deep chlorophyll maximum and strong internal tides are present.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Atmospheric carbon dioxide decline is hypothesized to drive the progressive cooling over the Cenozoic. However, the decline in the phytoplankton carbon isotopic fractionation (εp) from the early Oligocene to Miocene time interval, interpreted as a long term CO2 decline, differs from the apparent long term stability in climate indicators like benthic oxygen isotopes. Here, we produce two new long-term records of εp over the Oligocene to early Miocene time interval from widely separated locations at IODP Site 1406 and ODP 1168 and increase the resolution of determinations at the equatorial Atlantic ODP 925. These new results confirm a global trend of εp decline occurring during this interval. Rapid 3 ‰ declines are found from 27 to 24.5 million years ago (Ma) and 24 to 22.5 Ma, and minimum εp is attained at 19 Ma. Between 29.7 and 28.7 Ma at IODP 1406, a 20–30 ky sampling resolution reveals orbital scale 100 kyr cyclicity in εp. Making use of alkenone-based sea surface temperature (SST) estimates and benthic δ18O estimates extracted from the same samples, we perform a direct comparison with εp to evaluate the relationship with climate. We observe that across the long Oligocene to early Miocene interval, εp is positively correlated to SST only at the Southern Ocean Site 1168, but not with SST at the North Atlantic Site 1406. Accounting for the temperature-driven growth rate or cell size effects on εp does not lead to stronger correlations between εp and benthic δ18O nor stronger correlations between εp and SST at Site 1406. Moreover, at orbital timescale, the relationship between εp and benthic δ18O, albeit weak, implies greater ice volume or colder deep ocean at higher CO2. Despite the persistence of climate paradox, the reproducible trends in three widely separated sites, which experienced contrasting temperature evolution and likely experienced different variations in nutrient availability, suggest that a common CO2 forcing is likely the dominant control on the long term trends in εp. Changing ocean heat transport to the North Atlantic may contribute to the observed decoupling of long term εp and SST in this location.

                    We evaluate five commonly‐applied criteria to validate that a climate model is in so‐called “quasi‐equilibrium,” using a suite of five simulations with CO

                    concentrations between 1× and 16× Pre‐Industrial values. We find that major changes in ocean circulation can occur after common thermal equilibrium criteria are reached, such as a small Top of Atmosphere radiative flux imbalance, or weak trends in surface air temperature, sea surface temperature, and deep ocean temperature. Ocean circulation change, in turn, impact high‐latitude SAT, sea ice, and the Inter‐tropical Convergence Zone position. For future modeling studies and intercomparison projects aiming for an ocean in quasi‐equilibrium, we suggest that time series of key meridional overturning circulation (MOC) metrics in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Ocean are saved, and that MOC trends are less than 1 Sv/1000 years, and DOT trends less than 0.1°C/century for the final 1000 years of the simulations.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Future changes in El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the dominant mode of global climate variability, remain uncertain. Accordingly, large ensembles—which allow internally‐generated variations to be averaged out—are essential for assessing the response of ENSO to external forcing. In this study, we analyze state‐of‐the‐art large‐ensemble simulations from CMIP6 climate models and show that, in most models, ENSO frequency increases under anthropogenic warming. Two factors drive this frequency increase. First, a shift toward the Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño pattern—characterized by higher frequencies and greater amplitudes relative to the Central Pacific (CP) pattern. Second, an overall increase in the frequency of both EP and CP variability. These changes scale with the intensity of anthropogenic forcing. Most models also exhibit ENSO strengthening that begins in the  century and continues throughout the  century. Consequently, the observed intensification of ENSO during the second half of the  century could be of anthropogenic origin.

Further, the role of the photolysis of nitrate aerosols may be overestimated in recent studies and warrants further investigation.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Forecasting river discharge is essential for disaster risk reduction and water resource management, but forecasts of the future river state often contain errors. Post-processing reduces forecast errors but is usually only applied at the locations of river gauges, leaving the majority of the river network uncorrected. Here, we present a data-assimilation-inspired method for error-correcting ensemble simulations across gauged and ungauged locations in a post-processing step. Our new method employs state augmentation within the framework of the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). Using the LETKF, an error vector representing the forecast residual is estimated for each ensemble member. The LETKF uses ensemble error covariances to spread observational information from gauged to ungauged locations in a dynamic and computationally efficient manner. To improve the efficiency of the LETKF we define new localisation, covariance inflation, and initial ensemble generation techniques that can be easily transferred between modelling systems and river catchments. We implement and evaluate our new error-correction method for the entire Rhine-Meuse catchment using forecasts from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service's European Flood Awareness System (EFAS). The resulting river discharge ensembles are error-corrected at every grid box but remain spatially and temporally consistent. A spatial cross-validation strategy is used to assess the ability of the method to spread the correction along the river network to ungauged locations. The skill of the ensemble mean is improved at almost all locations including stations both up- and downstream of the assimilated observations. Whilst the ensemble spread is improved at short lead-times, at longer lead-times the ensemble spread is too large leading to an underconfident ensemble. In summary, our method successfully propagates error information along the river network, enabling error correction at ungauged locations. This technique can be used for improved post-event analysis and can be developed further to post-process operational forecasts providing more accurate knowledge about the future states of rivers.

## 674. Can discharge be used to inversely correct precipitation?

**DOI**: [10.5194/hess-29-6115-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-29-6115-2025)

**摘要**:

Abstract. This study explores the feasibility of using the information contained in observed streamflow measurements to inversely correct catchment-average precipitation time series provided by reanalysis products at the continental scale. We explore this possibility by training LSTM ensemble networks to inversely predict precipitation by using the streamflow of catchments as additional input. The first model uses discharge as an input feature along with other meteorological variables, while the second model uses only the meteorological predictors. Analysing the performance of both models showed that the discharge information not only led to an average improvement overall, but also resulted in a significant improvement (around 30 %) on days with precipitation amounts greater than 5 mm. An out-of-sample test showed that the inversely estimated precipitation is better able to reproduce small-scale, high-impact events that are poorly represented in the reanalysis product. Further, using the inversely generated precipitation time series for classical hydrological “forward” modeling resulted in improved estimates for streamflow and soil moisture. Given that the wealth of streamflow gauges around the world is currently underutilised for meteorological applications, our findings have significant implications for achieving better estimates of precipitation associated with high-impact flood events.

## 676. Mean Kinetic Energy and Its Projected Changes Dominate Over Eddy Kinetic Energy in the Arctic Ocean

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  As sea ice retreats in a warming climate, the Arctic Ocean is becoming more energetic; yet little is known about this additional energy's distribution in the water column. We use a high‐resolution (3–4 km) pan‐Arctic ocean‐sea ice model forced by present day and future scenarios to examine changes in mean kinetic energy (MKE) and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). Our study suggests that both the mean and eddy fields are becoming more energetic under anthropogenic forcing but changes in the mean circulation dominate the increase, concurrent with a spin‐up of the large‐scale circulation, concentrated in the top 200 m and along boundaries. The increase in EKE is strongest in the upper 50 m and is linked to enhanced baroclinic instability within the mean boundary currents. A better grasp of the distribution of this energy surplus helps to understand projected changes to stratification, mixing, and circulation in a future Arctic Ocean.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Rates of subsurface rock alteration by reactive flows are often independent of kinetic rates and governed solely by solute transport. This enables a major simplification that makes models tractable even for complex kinetic systems through the widely applied local equilibrium assumption. Here, this assumption is applied to the reactive Lauwerier problem (RLP), which describes non-isothermal fluid injection into a confined aquifer, leading to chemical disequilibrium. Specifically, the thermal changes drive temperature-dependent solubility variations, leading to undersaturation and dissolution or supersaturation precipitation reactions. Using this framework, solutions for reaction rate and porosity evolution are developed and analyzed, yielding a time-dependent criterion for their validity that incorporates time and thermal parameters. A key feature – the coalescence of thermal and reactive fronts – is used to explore their evolution over time in different settings. The applicability of the equilibrium model for important fluid–rock interaction processes is then examined and discussed, including sedimentary reservoir evolution and mineral carbonation in ultramafic rocks. Notably, the approach used here to extend thermal solutions for reactive processes suggests broader applicability. The findings also highlight that thermally driven reactive fronts, particularly near equilibrium, often become stationary after a relatively short period. As a result, their spatial evolution is governed by geological processes operating over much longer timescales.

**摘要**:

Prioritised Planning (PP) is a popular approach for multi-agent and multi-robot navigation. In PP, collision-free paths are computed for one agent at a time, following a total order over the agents, called a priority ordering. Many MAPF algorithms follow this approach or use it in some way, including several state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms, although it is known that PP is neither complete nor optimal. In this work, we characterise the space of problems a PP algorithm can solve, and define the search problem of identifying whether a given MAPF problem is in that space. We call this search problem Prioritised MAPF (P-MAPF) and investigate its computational complexity, showing that it is generally NP-hard. Then, we develop a novel efficient search algorithm called Path and Priority Search (PaPS), which solves P-MAPF, providing guarantees of completeness and optimality. We next observe that PP algorithms operate with two primary degrees of freedom – the choice of priority ordering, and the choice of individual paths for agents. Accordingly, we further divide P-MAPF into two planning problems corresponding to the two degrees of freedom. We call them Priority-Function Constrained MAPF (PFC-MAPF), where the path choice is fixed while the priority ordering is not, and Priority Constrained MAPF (PC-MAPF), where the priority ordering is fixed while the path choice is not. We analyse these problems as well, and show how PaPS can be easily adapted to create algorithms that solve these problems optimally. We experiment with our algorithms in a range of settings, including comparisons with existing PP baselines. Our results show how the different degrees of freedom of PP-based algorithms affect their behaviour, and provide the first-known results for solution-quality optimality for PP-based algorithms on a popular MAPF benchmark set. The latter can be used as a lower bound for any PP algorithm.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  
                    Extratropical peatlands in the Southern Hemisphere preserve detailed information on climatic and environmental change going back millennia. They are particularly valuable for understanding the evolution of the mid-latitude southern westerly winds (SWW), which play a major role in driving regional temperature and precipitation patterns, Antarctic sea-ice extent and ocean carbon fluxes. Here we investigate the timing and drivers of peatland initiation across the southern mid-latitudes after the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years ago) and test how this might relate to past changes in the SWW. We radiocarbon-date basal peats from the Falkland Islands and collate published basal peat radiocarbon ages from peat-forming regions south of 35° S. Using kernel density estimate models, we find distinct latitudinal phases of post-glacial peat initiation that suggest that peat growth is sensitive to variations in SWW position through their influence on moisture availability, temperature and dust deposition. A peak in peat growth in regions north of 52.5° S during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14,700–12,800 years ago) suggests an equatorward migration of the SWW, coinciding with a slowdown in atmospheric CO

**摘要**:

Abstract. As global and regional vegetation diversity loss threatens essential ecosystem services under climate change, monitoring biodiversity dynamics and its role in ecosystem services is crucial in predicting future states and providing insights into climate adaptation and mitigation. In this context, remote sensing (RS) offers a unique opportunity to assess long-term and large-scale biodiversity dynamics. However, the development of this capability suffers from the lack of consistent, global, and spatially matched ground diversity measurements that enable testing and validating generalizable methodologies. The Biodiversity Observing System Simulation Experiment (BOSSE) aims to alleviate the lack of this information by means of simulation. BOSSE simulates synthetic landscapes featuring communities of various vegetation species whose traits's seasonality and ecosystem functions (e.g., biospheric fluxes) respond to meteorology and environmental factors. Simultaneously, BOSSE can generate various types of remote sensing imagery linked to the traits and functions via radiative transfer theory. Specifically, it simulates hyperspectral reflectance factors (R), which can be convolved to the bands of specific RS missions, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and land surface temperature (LST). The resolution of the RS imagery can be degraded to test the robustness of different approaches to information loss and the capability of new methodologies to overcome this limitation. Therefore, BOSSE enables users to evaluate the capability of different methods to estimate plant functional diversity (PFD) from RS and link it to ecosystem functions. We expect BOSSE to support the benchmarking and improvement of old and novel methods dedicated to estimating plant diversity and exploring the biodiversity–ecosystem function (BEF) relationships, facilitating advances in this growing area of research and supporting the analysis and interpretation of real-world measurements. We also expect BOSSE to be extended and include new features that provide more realistic simulations that help answer more complex questions related to climate change and global warming.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Despite the challenge of measuring them due to their small intensities, oceanic vertical velocities (W) constitute essential key variables in understanding ocean dynamics, and ocean-atmosphere interactions and biogeochemical processes. Coastal events and fine-scale processes (1–100 km and days to weeks) can lead to high-intensity vertical velocities. Such processes can be observed in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. In particular, the Gulf of Lion is a region prone to intense north-westerly and easterly wind episodes that strongly impact the oceanic circulation. This work presents mooring ADCPs as reliable tools for physics-driven W measurements, with an adaptive algorithm which is applicable anywhere offshore in the ocean to detect W in fine-scale processes. The JULIO mooring (JUdicious Location for Intrusion Observation) is located on the boundary of the eastern side of the Gulf of Lion's shelf at the 100 m isobath. JULIO provides Eulerian measurements of three-dimensional current velocities over two main time-periods: 2012–2015, and since 2020. Vertical velocity measurements from JULIO show a good agreement with two independent methods: a Free-Fall Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler and an innovative Vertical Velocity Profiler. To measure physics-driven vertical velocities, we developed a method to identify and filter out biology-induced vertical velocities. Combining satellite and in situ observations with wind model outputs, we identify wind-induced downwelling and upwelling events at JULIO associated with physics-driven vertical velocities with maximum amplitudes of −465/127 m d−1. Hence, this analysis underlines the need for long term multimethod observations in such coastal areas forced by intense wind episodes.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223685](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223685)

**摘要**:

Terahertz synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can achieve high-resolution imaging of the target area through a large bandwidth, while squint imaging can flexibly detect the target area by adjusting the beam direction. However, the two-dimensional coupling effect intensifies under squint conditions, making it challenging for traditional frequency domain algorithms for high-resolution imaging. This paper analyzes the Doppler variations and proposes a two-dimensional decoupling algorithm for squint SAR imaging in the terahertz band. The proposed algorithm decouples in the time domain and combines the improved frequency scaling operation with the azimuthal nonlinear frequency scaling operation to obtain the focused SAR image. Compared to the Range Doppler algorithm and nonlinear frequency scaling algorithm, the simulation and experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which demonstrates the application potential for squint SAR imaging in the terahertz band.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>
                  Interpreting geophysical inversion results across diverse applications presents significant challenges, particularly when the resulting images lack distinct, sharp interfaces. Incorporating prior information to constrain the inversion process introduces additional complexity, especially when this prior information itself contains uncertainties. This work explores methods for improving the geometric representation of geologic structures using integrated geophysical and geologic models. While many existing approaches are either data-driven or model-driven techniques, they often fail to fully integrate available data into a dynamic, unified geomodel. We present an approach that integrates geologic models and geophysical data through structure-based inversion. Our approach preserves geological realism through an implicit model while imaging sharp contrasts within the geophysical inversion models. To address the ambiguities of solving for both the geometry and physical parameters, we adopt a sequential inversion process, first resolving shifts of geologic interfaces, then inverting for geophysical parameters using the updated geometry as a structural constraint. The method’s efficacy is demonstrated through cross-hole travel-time tomography using two synthetic and one field data set from the Mont Terri Rock Laboratory (MTRL). The field data results validate the capability of our approach to recover subsurface interface geometries from geophysical data that are comparable to the interpolated interfaces from borehole data. While we demonstrate the method for seismic travel time data in cross-hole geometry, the flexible open-source implementation allows application to 3D scenarios and other geophysical methods.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Heat waves are expected to increase in severity and frequency under climate change. Case studies have shown that heat waves typically occur during a coalescence of anomalous atmospheric and land surface conditions, but teasing apart the different contributing factors is a challenge, in part owing to difficulty in disentangling the role of soil moisture from that of atmospheric variations in solar radiation and thermal advection. Here, we provide evidence that low soil moisture is associated with extremely high temperatures in the midlatitudes and develop a theoretical framework to understand this association. We first show that a nonlinear relationship between soil moisture and temperature arises from energy and mass conservation at the land surface, then employ this relationship to quantify the influence of soil moisture on temperature variability. After deriving a diagnostic equation for the nonlinear temperature response to soil moisture variations, we obtain a dynamical Hasselmann-like model for the soil moisture variations themselves. We find that soil moisture fluctuations control the frequency of temperature extremes by slowly altering the land surface climate state on which atmospheric variability is superimposed, rather than by altering atmospheric variability itself. Our diagnostic model allows us to quantify how extreme an atmospheric anomaly needs to be to create a heat wave, conditional on the underlying soil moisture. By forcing our Hasselmann-like model for soil moisture with stochastic precipitation, we derive analytical solutions for the statistical moments of soil moisture.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Numerical models used to simulate the evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet require the specification of basal boundary conditions on stress and local deviations in the assumed material properties of the ice. In general, scalar fields relevant to these unknown components of the system are found by solving an inverse problem given observations of model state variables – typically ice flow speed. However, these optimisation problems are ill posed, resulting in degenerate solutions and poor conditioning. In this study, we propose the use of fracture and strain rate data to provide prior information to the inverse problem, in an effort to better constrain the inferred ice softness compared to more heuristic regularisation techniques. We use Pine Island Glacier as a case study and consider both a snapshot inverse problem in which ice softness and basal slip parameters are sought simultaneously over the glacier as a whole, and a time-dependent problem in which ice softness alone is sought over the floating ice shelf at regular intervals. In the first case, we construct a prior encoding the assumption that the ice softness will be close to our initial guess except from where we see fractures or high shear strain rates in satellite data. We investigate the solutions and conditioning of this data-informed inverse problem versus alternatives. The second proposed method makes the assumption that changes to ice softness occurring on monthly-to-annual timescales will be dominated by the fracturing of ice. We show that these methods can result in softness fields on floating ice that visually mimic fracture patterns without significantly affecting the solution misfit, perhaps leading to greater confidence in the softness fields as a representation of the true material properties of the ice shelf.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Particle number concentration (PNC) is a key parameter for assessing particles' effects on public health and climate. Although the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model has been widely used to investigate the particle mass concentrations in China, its capability of reproducing the PNC is unclear. After applying the default CMAQ model (version 5.3.2) in Beijing and Nanjing, the model underestimates PNC by 70 % to 80 % with the default Binary Homogeneous Nucleation (BHN) parameterization scheme. We then implement Ternary Homogeneous Nucleation (THN), Ion Mediated Nucleation (IMN), and sulfuric acid-dimethylamine (DMA) nucleation parameterization schemes into the CMAQ model. Seven modelling scenarios are conducted to explore the model's performance on PNC. The results indicate that the scenario with combined IMN and DMA scheme (SumID scheme) yields the best agreement with the observations, enhancing PNC during new particle formation (NPF) events by 84 % in Beijing and 36 % in Nanjing. In SumID scheme, IMN contributes to 56.30 % of the number concentrations in Beijing and 27.86 % in Nanjing, while DMA accounts for 28.15 % in Beijing and 29.27 % in Nanjing, respectively. IMN nucleation contributed PNC exhibits a pronounced diurnal variation with higher concentrations during the day and lower levels at night. DMA pathway predominantly influences NPF events during the morning and evening peak. This study enhances the model's capability to accurately simulate NPF events and underscores the significant influence of IMN and DMA nucleation on PNC in eastern cities.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The origin of geochemically enriched mantle in the asthenosphere is important to understanding the physical, thermal and chemical evolution of Earth’s interior. While subduction of oceanic sediments and deep mantle plumes have been implicated in this enrichment, they cannot fully explain the observed geochemical trends. Here we use geodynamic models to show that enriched mantle can be liberated from the roots of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle by highly organized convective erosion, a process tied to continental rifting and break-up. We demonstrate that this ‘chain’ of convective instabilities sweeps enriched lithospheric material into the suboceanic asthenosphere, in a predictable and quantifiable manner, over tens of millions of years—potentially faster for denser, removed keels. We test this model using geochemical data from the Indian Ocean Seamount Province, a near-continent site of enriched volcanism with minimal deep mantle plume influence. This region shows a peak in enriched mantle volcanism within 50 million years of break-up followed by a steady decline in enrichment, consistent with model predictions. We propose that persistent and long-distance lateral transport of locally metasomatized, removed keel can explain the billion-year-old enrichments in seamounts and ocean island volcanoes located off fragmented continents. Continental break-up causes a reorganization of shallow mantle dynamics that persists long after rifting, disturbing the geosphere and deep carbon cycle.

## 697. Dynamics of Downdrafts Around a Growing Convective Cloud: A Numerical Study

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  We examine the dynamics of cloud‐edge downdrafts over the growth phase of isolated cumuli, combining Eulerian and Lagrangian analyses. As in previous studies, our results show that growing cumuli are surrounded by downdrafts linked to cloud‐scale quasi‐toroidal circulations at all times at middle and upper cloud levels consistent with the thermal chain description of convective clouds. These toroidal circulations are responsible for the most intense cloud‐edge downdrafts in our simulations. In the upper cloud half, roughly 30%–50% of the upward mass flux is typically compensated within a radius of about twice the updraft radius in quasi‐laminar simulations forced by a warm bubble in an initially quiescent flow. In a turbulent cloud forced by surface fluxes, this compensation fraction is around 10%–30% over the same region. In contrast to the buoyancy‐centered view of subsiding shells, Eulerian and Lagrangian vertical momentum budget analyses show that the most intense cloud‐edge downdrafts in the turbulent setup, and after spin‐up of the toroidal circulation in the quasi‐laminar experiments, are predominantly mechanically forced (i.e., driven by dynamic pressure accelerations). This is consistent throughout the entire growth phase of the cumulus clouds and across tests with varying assumptions, including drier and moister environments. Despite dynamic pressure perturbations being the main driver of toroidal downdrafts, the downdraft speed (relative to the corresponding updraft velocity) exceeds the prediction of the non‐buoyant Hill's spherical vortex—a simple model frequently used for cloud‐scale circulations—by more than 30%.

## 698. Wetter, weaker, and more frequent monsoon low-pressure systems in CMIP6 future scenarios

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The South Asian monsoon is strongly influenced by synoptic-scale low-pressure systems (LPSs), which deliver the majority of seasonal and extreme rainfall. Here, we provide a robust synthesis of future LPS characteristics by analysing 13 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). We develop a novel, multi-component skill score (FLIP: Frequency, Location, Intensity, Precipitation) to evaluate and weight model performance against reanalysis benchmarks.
                  Our weighted multi-model projections reveal a consistent narrative for future monsoons: LPSs are projected to become more frequent and dynamically weaker in terms of low-level vorticity as global warming levels increase. Per-LPS precipitation is projected to increase, with a super-Clausius-Clapeyron scaling for the most intense storms, despite a general weakening of their circulation. We attribute this apparent paradox to a projected increase in the background meridional moisture gradient and a structural change whereby boundary layer winds weaken less than those in the free troposphere, maintaining strong frictional moisture convergence. Furthermore, LPSs are projected to penetrate deeper inland, with a significant increase in post-landfall duration between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming.
                  To deconstruct inter-model uncertainty, we employ a storyline approach based on unsupervised clustering of circulation and moisture anomalies. This reveals four physically self-consistent yet distinct future pathways that explain model diversity in LPS frequency, track, and precipitation changes. For example, a storyline with enhanced easterlies over Southeast Asia leads to a 36% increase in LPS frequency by transporting more precursor disturbances into the Bay of Bengal. Averaging over these diverse futures, the consistent outcome is a monsoon dominated by more numerous and wetter LPSs that track deeper into the subcontinent, expanding the risk of extreme rainfall and flooding to western parts of India.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission was launched on 28 May 2024. One of the most exciting new measurement capabilities of the EarthCARE mission is the CPR Doppler velocity measurement. The availability of Doppler measurements from space will offer a unique opportunity for the collection of a global dataset of vertical motions in clouds and precipitation. An important step in realizing this opportunity is to evaluate the CPR Doppler velocity measurements against those collected by surface-based observatories. Validation with two high-latitude surface-based Doppler radar observatories demonstrates that the CPR Level-2 Doppler velocities exhibit minimal biases (within a few cm s−1), especially in ice clouds. Even in low-level mixed-phase clouds, the CPR's Doppler velocity measurements provide reliable values, although careful consideration is needed for specific limitations such as vertical smoothing effects due to the radar's pulse length. Despite the inherent challenges associated with space-based Doppler measurements, these results suggest strong potential for the EarthCARE mission to provide unprecedented global climatological insights into hydrometeor sedimentation velocities.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223688](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223688)

**摘要**:

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as a high-resolution microwave remote sensing imaging technology, plays an indispensable role in both military and civilian applications. However, in complex electromagnetic countermeasure environments, radio frequency interference (RFI) severely degrades SAR imaging quality. SAR anti-interference, as a countermeasure method, has significantly practical values. Although deep learning-based anti-interference techniques have demonstrated notable advantages, two key issues remain unresolved: 1. Strong coupling between interference suppression and SAR imaging—most existing methods rely on raw echo data, leading to a complex processing pipeline and error accumulation. 2. Scarcity of labeled data—the lack of high-quality labeled data severely restricts model deployment. To address these challenges, this work constructs a standardized dataset and conducts comprehensive validation experiments based on this dataset. The main contributions are as follows: Firstly, this work establishes the mathematical model for block-type interference, laying a theoretical foundation for the subsequent construction of RFI-polluted data. Secondly, this work constructs a block-type interference dataset, which includes the labeled data constructed by our laboratory and open-source data from the Sentinel-1 satellites, providing reliable data support for deep learning. Thirdly, this work proposes an image subspace-based interference suppression method, which eliminates the dependence on raw echo data and significantly simplifies the processing pipeline. Finally, this work makes a fair comparison of the current works, summarizes the existing problems, and looks forward to possible future research directions.

**DOI**: [10.1613/jair.1.19649](https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.1.19649)

**摘要**:

Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) allows policies to be trained on pre-collected datasets without requiring additional interactions with the environment. This approach bypasses the need for real-time data acquisition in real-world applications, which can be impractical due to the safety issues inherent in the learning process. However, offline RL faces significant challenges, such as distributional shifts and extrapolation errors, and the resulting policies might underperform compared to the baseline policy. Safe policy improvement algorithms mitigate these issues, enabling the reliable deployment of RL approaches in real-world scenarios where historical data is available, guaranteeing that any policy changes will not result in worse performance compared to the baseline policy used to collect training data. In this paper, we propose MCTS-SPIBB, an algorithm that leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for scaling safe policy improvement to large domains. We theoretically prove that the policy generated by MCTS-SPIBB converges to the optimal safely improved policy produced by Safe Policy Improvement with Baseline Bootstrapping (SPIBB) as the number of simulations increases. Additionally, we introduce SDP-SPIBB, a novel extension of SPIBB designed to address the scalability limitations of the standard algorithm via Scalable Dynamic Programming. Our empirical analysis across four benchmark domains demonstrates that MCTS-SPIBB and SDP-SPIBB significantly enhance the scalability of safe policy improvement, providing robust and efficient algorithms for large-scale applications. These contributions represent a significant step towards the deployment of safe RL algorithms in complex real-world environments.

## 704. Impact of alignment strategy to the reference frame on the 3D annual station motions from different GNSS solutions

**作者**: Janusz Bogusz, Paul Rebischung, Anna Klos

**期刊**: Journal of Geodesy

**发表日期**: 2025-11-11

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  A comparison of the three-dimensional annual motions of the global Navigation satellite system (GNSS) stations in two different solutions – the latest reprocessing campaign of the International GNSS Service (IGS), and the station position time series provided by the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (NGL) – reveals large-scale differences with amplitudes of about 1 mm in horizontal and 3 mm in vertical. We show that these differences are largely explained, in the vertical component, by differences between the alignment strategies of both solutions to the terrestrial reference frame. Further comparisons with the annual displacements predicted by a global loading deformation model suggest that true annual station motions are less subject to aliasing, hence better preserved with the IGS alignment strategy. Considering these results, we urge providers of GNSS station position time series to take measures to minimize the aliasing of geophysical station motions that occur when aligning their daily station position estimates to the reference frame and propose different such measures.

## 705. Winter Wheat-Yield Estimation in the Huang-Huai-Hai Region Based on KNN-Ward Phenological Zoning and Multi-Source Data

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223686](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223686)

**摘要**:

Phenology is a key factor influencing the accuracy of regional-scale winter wheat-yield estimation. This study proposes a yield-estimation modeling framework centered on phenological zoning. Based on the remote sensing monitoring results of the heading stage of winter wheat in the Huang-Huai-Hai region from 2016 to 2021, the KNN-Ward spatial constraint clustering method was adopted to divide the Huang-Huai-Hai region into four consecutive wheat phenological zones. The results indicate a consistent spatio-temporal gradient in the phenology of winter wheat across the Huang-Huai-Hai region, characterized by later development in the northern areas and earlier development in the southern areas. The median day of year (DOY) for the heading stage in each zone varies by approximately 4 to 5 days, demonstrating a high degree of interannual stability. Building upon the phenological zoning outcomes, a multi-source data-driven random forest model was developed for wheat-yield estimation by integrating remote sensing data and meteorological variables during the wheat grain filling stage. This model incorporates remote sensing vegetation indices, crop growth parameters, and climatic factors as key input variables. Results show that the phenological zoning strategy significantly improves model prediction performance. Compared with the non-zoning model (R2 = 0.46, RRMSE = 13.02%), the phenological zone model shows strong performance under leave-one-year-out cross-validation, with R2 ranging from 0.54 to 0.68 and RRMSE below 12.50%. The phenological zoning model also exhibits more uniform residuals and higher prediction stability than models based on non-zoning, traditional agricultural zoning, and provincial administrative zoning. These results confirm the effectiveness of phenology-based zoning for regional yield estimation and provide a reliable framework for fine-scale crop yield monitoring. The phenological zoning model also demonstrates superior residual uniformity and prediction stability compared with models based on non-zoning, traditional agricultural zoning, and provincial administrative zoning. These results confirm the effectiveness of the multi-factor-driven modeling framework based on crop phenological zoning for regional yield estimation, providing a robust methodological foundation for fine-scale yield monitoring at the regional level.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Flood magnitude and frequency estimation are essential for the design of structural and nature-based flood risk management interventions and water resources planning. However, the global geography of hydrological observations is uneven, with many regions, especially in the Global South, having spatially and temporally sparse data that limit the choice of statistical methods for flood estimation. To address this data scarcity, we pool all available annual maximum flood data for the Philippines to estimate flood magnitudes at the national scale. Available river discharge data were collected from publications covering 842 sites, with data spanning from 1908 to 2018. Of these, 466 sites met criteria for reliable estimation of the annual maximum flood. Using the index flood approach, a range of controls was assessed at both national and regional scales using modern land cover and rainfall data sets, as well as geospatial catchment characteristics. Predictive equations for 2 to 100 year recurrence interval floods using only catchment area as a predictor have R2≤0.59. Adding a rainfall variable, the median annual maximum 1 d rainfall, increases R2 to between 0.56 for Q100 and 0.66 for Q2. Very few other topographic or land use variables were significant when added to multiple regression equations. Relatively low R2 values in flood predictions are typical of studies from tropical regions. Although the Philippines exhibits regional climate variability, residuals from national predictive equations show limited spatial structure, and region-specific equations do not significantly outperform the national equations. The predictive equations are suitable for use as design equations in ungauged catchments for the Philippines, but statistical uncertainties must be reported. Our approach demonstrates how combining individually short historical records, after careful screening and exclusion of unreliable data, can generate large data sets that can produce consistent results. Extension of continuous flood records by continuous and rated monitoring is required to reduce uncertainties. However, the national-scale consistency in our results suggests that extrapolation from a small number of carefully selected catchments could provide nationally reliable predictive equations with reduced uncertainties.

## 708. Generalized Variational Retrieval of Full Field-of-View Cloud Fraction and Precipitable Water Vapor from FY-4A/GIIRS Observations

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223687](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223687)

**摘要**:

Owing to their high vertical resolution, remote sensing data from meteorological satellite hyperspectral infrared sounders are well-suited for the identification, monitoring, and early warning of high-impact weather events. The effective utilization of full field-of-view (FOV) observations from satellite infrared sounders in high-impact weather applications remains a major research focus and technical challenge worldwide. This study proposes a generalized variational retrieval framework to estimate full FOV cloud fraction and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from observations of the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite. Based on this method, experiments are performed using high-frequency FY-4A/GIIRS observations during the landfall periods of Typhoon Lekima (2019) and Typhoon Higos (2020). A three-step channel selection strategy based on information entropy is first designed for FY-4A/GIIRS. A constrained generalized variational retrieval method coupled with a cloud cost function is then established. Cloud parameters, including effective cloud fraction and cloud-top pressure, are initially retrieved using the Minimum Residual Method (MRM) and used as initial cloud information. These parameters are iteratively optimized through cost-function minimization, yielding full FOV cloud fields and atmospheric profiles. Full FOV brightness temperature simulations are conducted over cloudy regions to quantitatively evaluate the retrieved cloud fractions, and the derived PWV is further applied to the identification and analysis of hazardous weather events. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating cloud parameters as auxiliary inputs to the radiative transfer model improves the simulation of FY-4A/GIIRS brightness temperature in cloud-covered areas and reduces brightness temperature biases. Compared with ERA5 Total Column Water Vapour (TCWV) data, the PWV derived from full FOV profiles containing cloud parameter information shows closer agreement and, at certain FOVs, more effectively indicates the occurrence of high-impact weather events. The simplified methodology proposed in this study provides a robust basis for the future assimilation and operational utilization of infrared data over cloud-affected regions in numerical weather prediction models.

## 712. Stratospheric gravity waves in a post-limb sounder era: can GNSS-RO be used to extend the SABER QBO-driving record?

**摘要**:

Abstract. The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is a slowly repeating cycle of winds which dominates tropical lower-stratospheric dynamics and has been described as the “heartbeat of the stratosphere”. However, it is challenging to represent in weather and climate models because its periodicity and magnitude are controlled by small-scale gravity waves (GWs) that cannot be resolved on model grids. To quantify this GW driving we require high-resolution measurements, ideally from satellites to ensure full spatial coverage. Since 2002, the SABER instrument on the TIMED satellite has provided such data, facilitating long-term studies of QBO GW driving. However, SABER is expected to be decommissioned later this year, and no replacement is planned. Here, we assess the possibility of using GNSS-RO data to extend the 23-year SABER record. GNSS-RO cannot be used as a simple replacement for long-term studies because data volumes are too low before 2006 and for most of the late 2010s, and thus, we ideally wish to supplement rather than replace the SABER record. However, while the two datasets have broadly similar lower stratospheric resolutions when compared to the full Earth observation constellation, GNSS-RO measurements are higher resolution in all three dimensions than SABER and are oriented differently in 3D space. As a result of this, GNSS-RO GW measurements exhibit much larger GW potential energies (GWPE) and shorter vertical wavelengths than those from SABER. To understand these differences, we use a high-resolution run of the GEOS model to produce synthetic GW measurements, then systematically vary the measurement characteristics between those of the two real instruments. This allows us to identify the key drivers of the different GW properties they measure. We demonstrate that the differences between QBO-driving GW properties measured by the two instruments are primarily due to vertical resolution, with horizontal resolution (either along or across line of sight) and orientation angle playing a negligible role. We further demonstrate that, with a simple vertical smoothing of the GNSS-RO data in the vertical before analysis for GWs, the measured GW properties become near-identical, allowing us to use SABER and GNSS-RO data near-equivalently for this use case. Since GNSS-RO data are now a crucial component of the global numerical weather prediction constellation and are hence highly likely to be available in the long term, this allows us to produce a consistent long-term record of QBO GW forcing from 2002 onwards without key gaps which would be otherwise present in the early 2000s and late 2010s.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Vehicular emissions significantly impact atmospheric composition, yet their behavior in high-altitude environments remains poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of vehicular emissions conducted across ten tunnels on the Tibetan Plateau, encompassing nearly 3000 m of altitudinal variation. Our findings reveal that total emission factors of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increase with altitude, driven primarily by a pronounced rise in evaporative emissions. Source apportionment indicates that evaporative emissions contribute 67 % of the total VOCs, markedly outweighing the 24 % from tailpipe exhaust, a pattern that diverges from those observed at lower altitudes, where tailpipe emissions dominate. We identify low atmospheric pressure as the key factor enhancing evaporative VOC release at high altitudes. This study offers critical new insights into the mechanisms of vehicular emissions in plateau regions, underscoring the necessity of accounting for specific environmental conditions and fuel evaporation when formulating emission control strategies for high-altitude settings.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Surface processes such as erosion and sedimentation play a critical role in crustal deformation, particularly in actively deforming orogenic belts. While these processes have been extensively studied in large-scale erosive and tectonically active regions, the specific effects of valley incision on crustal deformation, especially in tectonically inactive regions, remain poorly understood. In this study, we hypothesize that crustal deformation induced by valley incision is primarily governed by three parameters: incision velocity, crustal thickness, and the elevation difference between the plateau and the valley base level. Using two-dimensional (2D) thermomechanical models, we investigate the influence of valley incision on crustal deformation and exhumation by varying these parameters. Our results show that valley incision alone can induce significant crustal deformation, associated with lateral viscous flow in the lower crust leading to near-vertical channel flow and extensional brittle deformation in the upper crust below the valley. This deformation leads to lower-crust exhumation, within a 10 Myr time frame, if crustal thickness is greater than 50 km, the initial plateau elevation is greater than or equal to 2 km, and the long-term effective erosion rate exceeds 0.5 mm yr−1. Furthermore, while the onset of lower-crust exhumation is primarily controlled by the initial plateau elevation, the total amount of exhumed lower crust after 10 Myr strongly increases with the initial thickness of the lower crust which favors viscous flow. Moreover, natural systems that exhibit the required crustal thickness, plateau elevation, and erosion rates for lower-crustal exhumation, as highlighted in our models, also demonstrate active lower-crustal exhumation, as is the case in regions such as Nanga Parbat and Namcha Barwa. These findings offer new insights into the coupling between surface processes and deep crustal dynamics, highlighting the potential for valley incision to drive substantial crustal deformation and promote lower-crustal exhumation.

<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>
                  Seismic reflection and transmission provide essential insights into the composition of reservoir solids and fluids. Reservoir media often consist of layered structures that contain solids, fluids, pores, and cracks. In such complex layered media, the stable and accurate modeling of seismic wave propagation is crucial for effective reservoir evaluation using seismic waves. By solving the cracked porous medium wave equation for layered structures using the propagator matrix method, we calculate the frequency-dependent oblique incident P-SV and SH wave reflection and transmission for the layered poroelastic media containing cracks. This approach accounts for the combined effects of impedance contrast and crack squirt flow on wave reflection and transmission. The newly developed model includes interlayer fluid flow, crack squirt flow, and global fluid flow. Among these mechanisms, interlayer fluid flow and crack squirt flow can both be prominent in the seismic frequency band. Then, the model was applied to simulate seismic reflection and transmission in cracked interlayer and interface geological structures. The results show that the pore-crack squirt flow mechanism plays a significant role in determining seismic reflection and transmission. Increased crack density and gas saturation significantly enhance P-wave reflection and generate seismic reflection bright spots, while for the S-wave reflection, the effect is largely controlled by crack density, and, when crack density is high, is moderately affected by fluid saturation. This fluid sensitivity results from the crack squirt flow mechanism, which is absent from the classical Biot-Gassmann theory. In all known limiting cases, the model predictions agree with those from the Biot-Gassmann theory.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  On November 6, 2024, the Parker Solar Probe flew past Venus to make the first accurate electric field measurement in the nightside Venusian magnetosphere. To achieve this result, the electric field antennas were current biased in a way never before experienced by an electric field detector at Venus. This biasing requirement, that the positive bias current in the Venus shadow be about equal to the electron thermal current, is discussed and illustrated. About one minute of useful electric field data in the eight minute nightside magnetosphere crossing was obtained, during which the only feature observed was a few Hz signal. This result, along with the magnetic field measurements, showed that there were few if any electromagnetic waves, such as low frequency electromagnetic turbulence or whistlers, in the nightside crossing. Instead, a few Hertz, purely electrostatic signal was found. This suggests that the interaction of the solar wind with an unmagnetized body having an ionosphere may be different from that of previously studied magnetized bodies. In the sunlit flanks, many electromagnetic wave modes were observed. An additional result of this research is development of an improved algorithm for biasing electric field antennas in the Sun’s shadow which improves on guessing the bias current as done in this research.

## 721. Seasonal and Spatial Variations of Vertical Profile Heating (VPH) Latent Heat Over Northern East Asia Based on GPM Observations

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Latent heating (LH) from precipitation strongly modulates convection and large‐scale circulation, yet its three‐dimensional structure at mid‐high latitudes remains under‐characterized. Utilizing 2014–2021 Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) observations and the vertical profile heating (VPH) method, we quantify LH over northern East Asia (30°–60°N, 105°–140°E) and document its seasonal, meridional, and land‐sea contrasts. Relative to spring/autumn, summer precipitation exhibits higher rain tops, elevated positive/negative turning points, and stronger LH with peak release occurring 1–2 km higher for comparable near‐surface rain rates or echo‐top heights viewing the average latent heat profiles. From 30°N to 60°N, the heights of maximum heating, the sign‐change (turning) levels, and the LH top all decrease poleward by ∼1–2 km consistent with lower freezing levels in colder climates. The horizontal pattern of LH mirrors both latitude and land‐sea distribution: heating at ∼5 km is amplified over coastal/peninsular regions compared with inland mountains. Spectral analyses show that increasing precipitation intensity shifts profiles toward convective‐type, column‐deep heating and lowers the turning level. Intercomparisons with GPM Goddard convective‐stratiform heating (CSH) and spectral latent heating (SLH) products confirm the temporal and vertical robustness of these patterns; mid‐tropospheric heating is comparable across data sets, whereas VPH retrieves markedly stronger low‐level cooling than CSH/SLH. Uncertainties arise from DPR's limited snowfall sensitivity (winter underestimation) and potential low‐level cold bias in VPH, where raindrop breakup mimics evaporation. These results provide a midlatitude LH climatology that benchmarks models, clarifies seasonal/meridional controls on LH vertical structure, and informs simulations of monsoon evolution and extratropical cyclone development.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Mediterranean cyclones induce significant biogeochemical perturbations in the Mediterranean Sea, with particularly notable effects on chlorophyll a (Chl a) dynamics. This study examines Chl a variability during twenty Mediterranean cyclones, comparing offshore and nearshore responses. Through an integrated investigation of reanalysis products, ARGO float observations, and Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery, we quantified vertical and surface Chl a concentrations, while concurrently assessing nitrate distribution, currents, and mixed layer depth (MLD) variability. Our results revealed that both tropical-like cyclones and extratropical cyclones generated a pronounced uplift of the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in cyclones exhibiting slow-moving phases. Notably, wind-driven upwelling and air–sea heat exchange critically govern DCM uplift for these cyclones. We demonstrated that these physical mechanisms collectively drive DCM uplift along the trajectories of intense, slow-moving Mediterranean cyclones, with significant implications for nutrient cycling and primary productivity across the Mediterranean basin.

                    The air‐water interface acts as a gateway to absorption and aqueous‐phase reaction of gases in the atmosphere. Numerous aqueous organic aerosols are emitted into the troposphere by biomass burning. The surface of such aqueous organic aerosols is then potentially covered by organic surfactants, modifying its properties and hence also the photosensitized oxidation of gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO
                    <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>
                    ). It is therefore desirable to explore how such reactions are influenced by the presence of surfactants. First, we investigated the effect of surfactants on the uptake rate of SO
                    <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>
                    on vanillin, 4‐benzoylbenzoic acid, and humic acid films. The uptake coefficient of SO
                    <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>
                    is increased by approximately a factor of 2–3 under acidic conditions (a pH of 2), compared to that on the humic acid alone film, especially. Second, ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with high‐resolution mass spectrometry was employed to analyze organosulfur compounds, demonstrating the effect of the surfactant‐covered surface on the products. It was found that surfactants, by promoting the interfacial abundance of photosensitizers, facilitate the formation of organosulfur compounds, indicating that the concentration effect is a critical factor in photosensitized interfacial chemistry of aerosols between the bulk liquid water and the gas phase, as it induces abundant product formation at the air‐aqueous interface.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  On 9 October 2022, a powerful gamma ray burst (GRB), GRB221009A, caused significant changes in the electron density of the lower ionosphere, as evidenced by VLF (3–30 kHz) radio wave observations. However, GRB221009A did not yield any observable signatures at the Schumann resonances (∼8, ∼14 Hz), which are also sensitive to the lower ionosphere. We show that the effects of GRB221009A are observable in a decrease in propagation velocity of ELF (3–1,000 Hz) lightning impulses. Analytical and numerical analysis points to an ionospheric perturbation in which the GRB increased the daytime electron density uniformly over a wide altitude range from 50 to 90 km. The GRB perturbation is markedly different from perturbations from solar flares, which significantly increase the vertical gradient of the electron density. ELF propagation velocity is shown to be a technique that can identify the altitude range of ionospheric perturbations.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The Wind Synthesis System using Doppler Measurements (WISSDOM) is a practical scheme employed to derive high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) winds using any number of radars. This study evaluated the advantages of using multiple radars with different wavelengths in WISSDOM for the analysis of bow-shaped convection in a severe squall line recorded on 2 August 2020. A total of 11 radars were in operation in the areas surrounding Seoul metropolitan, South Korea: four S-band, two C-band, and five X-band radars. The advantages of using these radars were assessed using six different synthesis scenarios: (1) four S-band (scenario S), (2) two C-band (scenario C), (3) five X-band (scenario X), (4) a combination of four S- and two C-band (scenario SC), (5) four S- and five X-band (scenario SX), and (6) four S-, two C-, and five X-band radars (scenario SCX). The results revealed that scenario S offered good coverage in the synthesis domain, but relatively fewer observations were produced near the surface. In contrast, scenarios C and X provided sufficient data at lower levels but less coverage in the areas far from the radars. The scenarios SC and SX captured the return flow at low levels similar to typical squall line structures. Overall, the scenario SCX led to the optimal synthesis when compared with the observations. The mean bias (MB) of the U- and V-winds between the sounding observations and scenario SCX was 0.7 and 0.5 m s−1, respectively, while the root mean square difference (RMSD) of the U- and V-winds were around 1.7 m s−1. In addition, when comparing the retrieved WISSDOM winds with three radar wind profiler observations, the average MB (RMSD) for the U-, V-, and W-winds was 1.4, 2.0, and 1.0 m s−1 (3.1, 3.9, and 1.5 m s−1), respectively. The significant differences between scenarios S and SCX can be attributed to additional low-level observations in SCX, which allowed for the capture of stronger updrafts in the convection areas of the squall line. Overall, these results highlight the advantages of using radars with multiple wavelengths in WISSDOM, especially C- and X-band radars.

**DOI**: [10.1613/jair.1.17602](https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.1.17602)

**摘要**:

Transfer learning aims to transfer knowledge or information from a source domain to a relevant target domain. In this paper, we understand transfer learning from the perspectives of knowledge transferability and trustworthiness. This involves two research questions: How is knowledge transferability quantitatively measured and enhanced across domains? Can we trust the transferred knowledge in the transfer learning process? To answer these questions, this paper provides a comprehensive review of trustworthy transfer learning from various aspects, including problem definitions, theoretical analysis, empirical algorithms, and real-world applications. Specifically, we summarize recent theories and algorithms for understanding knowledge transferability under (within-domain) IID and non-IID assumptions. In addition to knowledge transferability, we review the impact of trustworthiness on transfer learning, e.g., whether the transferred knowledge is adversarially robust or algorithmically fair, how to transfer the knowledge under privacy-preserving constraints, etc. Beyond discussing the current advancements, we highlight the open questions and future directions for understanding transfer learning in a reliable and trustworthy manner.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Many cities attempt to mitigate poor air quality by increasing tree canopy cover. Trees can indeed capture pollutants and reduce their dispersion, but they can also negatively impact urban air quality. For example, trees emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that participate in both ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, yet these emissions have been little studied in urban contexts. We sampled BVOCs from the leaves of mature urban trees using lightweight enclosures and adsorbent tubes in two cities: Montreal, Canada and Helsinki, Finland. In both cities, we targeted five common broadleaved species in parks and streets, comparing their standardised BVOC emission potentials to nonurban BVOC emission potential estimates from emission databases. We also calculated the potential O3 and SOA formation by the study species at the leaf scale and upscaled to the neighbourhood. We found that the measured BVOC emission potentials generally deviated little from the emission database estimates, supporting the use of database estimates for urban trees. However, tree-to-tree variation in the BVOC emission potentials was large, with slight differences between park and street trees. Compared to park trees, street tree emissions were higher in Montreal (specifically isoprene and sesquiterpenoids) and lower in Helsinki (specifically green leaf volatiles). Finally, we found that O3 formation from our study species' BVOC emissions was dominated by isoprene, while SOA formation was also affected by lower monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid emissions. These findings highlight the importance of species selection and management strategies that protect trees from BVOC-inducing stresses.

## 734. Influence of surrounding topography on earthquake ground motions in intermontane basin settings: Insights from the Kathmandu basin

**作者**: Himanshu Agrawal, Mark Naylor, Karim Tarbali

**期刊**: Geophysical Journal International

**发表日期**: 2025-11-11

**DOI**: [10.1093/gji/ggaf458](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggaf458)

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>
                  Intermontane basins in active orogenic regions face significant seismic hazard due to their proximity to sustained tectonic activity. While the sediments deposited in these basins create a relatively flat topography suitable for urban and infrastructure developments, their unconsolidated sedimentary fill locally amplifies earthquake-induced ground motions, thereby increasing the seismic hazard and risk. Documented observations suggest that ground motion estimates in these basins are often poorly constrained due to oversight of surrounding surface topography and insufficient sub-surface information about deeper basin layering, leading to inaccurate hazard assessments. In this study, we systematically evaluate the implications of these two factors on ground motion characteristics up to 4.4 Hz, which is crucial for earthquake engineering practices. We conducted 3D simulations around the Kathmandu catchment area (Nepal) using hypothetical thrust-faulting moment tensor sources at various depths and locations. The results show a significant reduction, by an order of magnitude, in the peak ground velocities (PGV) at the catchment area due to surface topography. However, this effect is prominent only for very shallow earthquakes producing predominant surface waves; for deeper sources, the de-amplification may be negligible or even result in amplification due to scattered body waves converted into surface waves. To incorporate basin-specific material properties, we performed the analysis in a computationally-feasible 2D domain, which shows that the existence of topography can reduce the energy entering the basin, hence resulting in a reduced basin amplification. The deeper layers of the Kathmandu basin play a critical role in controlling the spatial variability of the observed amplification, with significant differences within the basin compared to scenarios that exclude these deeper layers. We conclude that neglecting topography in ground motion predictions may lead to an overestimation of ground motion amplification in the basin. Pronounced topographic features in the surrounding of intermontane basins can result in further scattering of the received energy content from earthquakes occurring outside of the basin, especially for the high-frequency motions. In addition, in order to provide site-specific measures of ground motion in intermontane basins, high spatial resolution of the underlying geological structure is deemed imperative.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a skillful predictor for seasonal tropical cyclone (TC) activity in most TC basins. This study examines recent changes in the observed ENSO‐TC teleconnection strength, as measured by ENSO modulation of hurricane frequency. We find that the ENSO‐North Atlantic TC teleconnection fluctuated over time, with the strongest relationship occurring from the 1980s to the mid‐2000s. In the western and eastern North Pacific, the ENSO‐TC teleconnection has strengthened in recent decades. Periods with a strong ENSO‐TC teleconnection are associated with more favorable environmental conditions for TCs, with higher values of genesis potential indices. Positive phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation coincided with periods of strong ENSO‐TC teleconnections in the Atlantic and North Pacific basins. A weaker Atlantic ENSO‐TC relationship was associated with negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation. This research reveals climate conditions that modulate ENSO's utility for seasonal TC prediction.

**arXiv**: [2511.07090v4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07090v4)

**摘要**:

Across the Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle - from hardware to development, deployment, and reuse - burdens span energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts. Cloud provider tools improve transparency but remain heterogeneous and often omit water and value chain effects, limiting comparability and reproducibility. Addressing these multi dimensional burdens requires a lifecycle approach linking phase explicit mapping with system levers (hardware, placement, energy mix, cooling, scheduling) and calibrated measurement across facility, system, device, and workload levels. This article (i) establishes a unified, operational definition of Green AI distinct from Sustainable AI; (ii) formalizes a five phase lifecycle mapped to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) stages, making energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts first class; (iii) specifies governance via Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycles with decision gateways; (iv) systematizes hardware and system level strategies across the edge cloud continuum to reduce embodied burdens; and (v) defines a calibrated measurement framework combining estimator models with direct metering to enable reproducible, provider agnostic comparisons. Combining definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement, this article offers actionable, evidence based guidance for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

**摘要**:

The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded AI capabilities to visual modalities, yet existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-video understanding, overlooking the critical need for multi-video understanding in real-world scenarios (e.g., sports analytics and autonomous driving). To address this significant gap, we introduce MVU-Eval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multi-Video Understanding for MLLMs. Specifically, our MVU-Eval mainly assesses eight core competencies through 1,824 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 4,959 videos from diverse domains, addressing both fundamental perception tasks and high-order reasoning tasks. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications such as multi-sensor synthesis in autonomous systems and cross-angle sports analytics. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we reveal significant performance discrepancies and limitations in current MLLMs' ability to perform understanding across multiple videos. The benchmark will be made publicly available to foster future research.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-10

**arXiv**: [2511.06625v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06625v2)

**摘要**:

Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.

**摘要**:

Large Language Models (LLMs) and causal learning each hold strong potential for clinical decision making (CDM). However, their synergy remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2 real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and 3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical data. While the direct integration yields limited improvement, our benchmark reveals a more promising synergy.

**arXiv**: [2511.07170v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07170v2)

**摘要**:

Current graph neural network (GNN) model-stealing methods rely heavily on queries to the victim model, assuming no hard query limits. However, in reality, the number of allowed queries can be severely limited. In this paper, we demonstrate how an adversary can extract a GNN with very limited interactions with the model. Our approach first enables the adversary to obtain the model backbone without making direct queries to the victim model and then to strategically utilize a fixed query limit to extract the most informative data. The experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, even under a very restricted query limit and under defense against model extraction in place. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against GNN model extraction threats.

**arXiv**: [2511.07503v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07503v2)

**摘要**:

The increased availability of genetic data has transformed genomics research, but raised many privacy concerns regarding its handling due to its sensitive nature. This work explores the use of language models (LMs) for the generation of synthetic genetic mutation profiles, leveraging differential privacy (DP) for the protection of sensitive genetic data. We empirically evaluate the privacy guarantees of our DP modes by introducing a novel Biologically-Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attack (biHMIA), which combines traditional black box MIA with contextual genomics metrics for enhanced attack power. Our experiments show that both small and large transformer GPT-like models are viable synthetic variant generators for small-scale genomics, and that our hybrid attack leads, on average, to higher adversarial success compared to traditional metric-based MIAs.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Northern China's arid lands constitute one of Earth's most active aeolian ecosystems, yet persistent uncertainties remain regarding the precise source apportionment of dust emissions impacting downstream regions. By applying advanced geochemical fingerprinting techniques to modern airborne dust samples collected from 11 to 29 April 2023 across major potential provenance areas (Taklimakan, Gurbantunggut, Hexi Corridor, Heihe River Basin, Alxa Plateau, and Qaidam Basin Desert), we systematically quantified dust provenance through coupled rare earth element signatures and trace element ratios. Our multivariate analysis reveals three critical findings: (1) The Taklimakan and Gurbantunggut deserts dominate as primary provenance than Alxa Plateau, Hexi Corridor and Heihe Basin and the Qaidam Basin Desert; (2) Despite the Taklimakan and Gurbantunggut Desert's upwind position relative to the CLP, the intervening Alxa Plateau (&gt; 1500 ma.s.l.) acts as a topographic filter of dust destined for the Lanzhou and Mu Us regions while facilitating multi-phase recycling through localized deposition and remobilization; (3) Provenance shifts exhibit strong spatial dependency, with Lanzhou's dust load dominated by Gurbantunggut provenance (26.1 %), then Taklimakan (18.3 %); but Mu Us dust dominated by Alxa (27.5 %), then Taklimakan (21.6 %). These findings redefine our understanding of East Asian dust dynamics by demonstrating how elevation barriers and sedimentary recycling jointly modulate source-sink relationships over millennial scales.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Understanding the factors controlling surface–atmosphere exchange of ammonia (NH3) in grazed grasslands is crucial for improving atmospheric models and addressing environmental concerns associated with reactive nitrogen. This study presents high-resolution NH3 flux data collected during four spring campaigns (2021–2024) at an intensively managed grassland site in Northwestern France, using the aerodynamic gradient method (AGM) alongside continuous monitoring of environmental variables and agricultural management. AGM-derived half-hourly NH3 fluxes exhibited distinctive patterns: (i) high variability during grazing from −113 (deposition) to +3205 (emission) ng NH3 m−2 s−1, influenced by meteorology, grazing livestock density, and vegetation and soil dynamics; (ii) strong diurnal patterns and day-to-day variability; and (iii) transient volatilisation peaks following slurry applications (up to 10 235 ng NH3 m−2 s−1). Grazing-induced emission fluxes often persisted for up to 1–2 weeks following cattle departure. Relative random uncertainties associated with AGM flux measurements typically ranged from 15 % to 70 %, based on errors in vertical concentration gradient slopes and variables related to turbulence and stability. Additional methodological limitations and systematic uncertainties are discussed, in particular errors associated with fundamental AGM assumptions and flux footprint attribution in a rotational grazing setup. The mean overall cattle head-based emission factor (EF) was 6.5 g NH3-N cow−1 grazing d−1 but varied considerably between grazing events, from 1 to 23 g NH3-N cow−1 grazing d−1, reflecting the interplay between livestock management and environmental factors. This study highlights the importance of long-term, continuous, high-resolution measurements to document the large variability in grazing-induced NH3 fluxes. The findings also underscore the need for refining bi-directional exchange models that integrate physics (meteorology, turbulence), environmental biogeochemistry (the fate of excreted nitrogen in the soil), biology (dynamic vegetation processes) and pasture management (grazing intensity) in grazed grassland systems.

## 744. The diurnal susceptibility of subtropical clouds to aerosols

**期刊**: Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics

**发表日期**: 2025-11-10

**DOI**: [10.5194/acp-25-15329-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-25-15329-2025)

**摘要**:

Abstract. The diurnal susceptibility of clouds and their radiative properties to aerosols is examined during their Lagrangian transition from subtropical stratocumulus to shallow cumulus regimes. Using large-eddy simulations, we analyze the six-day evolution of an air mass along a 3800 km observed trajectory from the coast of Peru toward the equator. Pristine and polluted scenarios are simulated with forcing imposed from weather reanalysis. The polluted scenario exhibits stronger diurnal variations in cloud water, cloud fraction, and albedo, with enhanced nighttime entrainment and suppressed precipitation. The overall response of cloud properties and outgoing shortwave radiation to droplet number concentration follows a distinct diurnal pattern: strong positive cloud adjustments dominate at night and in the morning, while weak negative adjustments prevail in the afternoon. This cycle is driven by the competition between precipitation suppression, which enhances cloud water and coverage, and entrainment drying, which depletes them. In polluted conditions, enhanced entrainment leads to a deeper and more decoupled boundary layer that cannot be sustained by surface fluxes in the afternoon, resulting in negative cloud adjustments. The enhanced entrainment rate under polluted conditions is caused by the reduced sedimentation of cloud and precipitation water from the entrainment zone. While the Twomey effect dominates the diurnal average albedo response, the diurnal variation in the competing cloud adjustments lead to a near-neutral net susceptibility in the afternoon, highlighting the critical role of diurnally varying processes in aerosol-cloud interactions.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Terpenoids influence atmospheric chemistry through rapid oxidation reactions which form secondary products including ozone and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Source apportionment of terpenoids is complicated in urban environments because there are biogenic and anthropogenic sources. This study utilizes measured fluxes of isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes with MEGAN, a biogenic emissions model, and FIVE-VCP, an anthropogenic emissions inventory, to characterize urban terpenoid emissions. Volatile organic compound (VOC) mixing ratios were measured using a Vocus proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) during the URBAN-EC (Urban Research on Biogenic and ANthropogenic Emissions of Carbon) study in Berkeley, California from May to November 2022. Fluxes were calculated using the eddy covariance technique. Median fluxes of isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes were 0.269, 0.182, and 0.013 nmol m−2 s−1 respectively. Terpenoids were 2 % of the measured molar flux, 26 % of OH reactivity flux, and 21 % of SOA formation potential. The MEGAN isoprene emission factor was 4.56 nmol (m2 leaf area)−1 s−1. MEGAN isoprene fluxes matched URBAN-EC distributions seasonally and diurnally, while MEGAN monoterpene and sesquiterpene fluxes had more pronounced seasonal trends and lower morning emissions relative to URBAN-EC. Weekday/weekend differences were used to determine if terpenoids had anthropogenic sources. Monoterpene and sesquiterpene fluxes were significantly higher on weekdays (p&lt;0.05); these differences were not represented in MEGAN or FIVE-VCP. Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes had lower-bound anthropogenic fractions of 23 % and 24 %. Personal care products were not an important contributor to monoterpene emissions. This study presents a detailed analysis of urban terpenoid fluxes and contributes to better understanding their sources.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Accurate soil moisture monitoring is essential for agriculture and disaster prevention. However, existing methods often rely on expensive sensors or are limited by satellite coverage. In this study, we propose a low-cost and practical method for estimating soil permittivity using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data in the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) format from low-cost mass-market GNSS receivers. We developed a theoretical model that links SNR amplitude to soil permittivity via the Fresnel reflection coefficient and validated it through field experiments at multiple antenna heights. By interpolating the elevation angle data and analyzing the SNR amplitude at elevation angles of 20°or greater, we minimized the effects of nonlinearity and achieved a strong correlation with independently measured soil permittivity. Our results demonstrate that lower antenna heights enhance accuracy and reduce variability. This method enables calibration at a single location and permits accurate permittivity estimation at other sites using only low-cost mass-market GNSS devices. The approach offers a scalable and affordable solution for soil moisture estimation across various soil textures, thereby enhancing the applicability of GNSS-IR in precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Gaseous ammonia (NH3) is an important precursor for secondary aerosol formation and contributes to reactive nitrogen deposition. NH3 dry deposition is poorly quantified due to the complex bidirectional nature of NH3 atmosphere-surface exchange and lack of high time-resolution in situ NH3 concentration and meteorological measurements. To better quantify NH3 dry deposition, measurements of NH3 were made above a subalpine forest canopy in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) and used with in situ micrometeorology to simulate bidirectional fluxes. NH3 dry deposition was largest during the summer, with 47 % of annual net NH3 dry deposition occurring in June, July, and August. Because in situ, high time-resolution concentration and meteorological data are often unavailable, the impacts on estimated deposition from utilizing more commonly available biweekly NH3 measurements and ERA5 meteorology were evaluated. Fluxes simulated with biweekly NH3 concentrations, commonly available from NH3 monitoring networks, underestimated NH3 dry deposition by 45 %. These fluxes were strongly correlated with 30 min fluxes integrated to a biweekly basis (R2 = 0.88), indicating that a correction factor could be applied to mitigate the observed bias. Application of an average NH3 diel concentration pattern to the biweekly NH3 concentration data removed the observed low bias. Annual NH3 dry deposition from fluxes simulated with reanalysis meteorological inputs exceeded simulations using in situ meteorology measurements by a factor of 2.

**DOI**: [10.5194/amt-18-6361-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-18-6361-2025)

**摘要**:

Abstract. Accurate cloud detection over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is crucial for understanding regional weather patterns and global climate dynamics. Yet, it remains challenging due to harsh environmental conditions and sparse observations. While ground-based infrared radiometers offer a promising solution through downwelling infrared brightness temperature (IRBT) measurements, existing algorithms require supplementary meteorological data often unavailable in remote TP regions. This study presents a novel cloud detection algorithm that operates solely on IRBT data from a single ground-based infrared radiometer, addressing the critical need for autonomous cloud monitoring in resource-limited environments. The algorithm integrates spectral and temporal analysis approaches: the spectral test identifies cloud presence by comparing observed IRBT against statistically derived clear-sky diurnal cycles, and the temporal test detects clouds through IRBT variability analysis using sliding standard deviation calculations. A key innovation includes a normalization procedure that effectively mitigates dust contamination effects – a persistent challenge in the arid TP environment that can introduce extremely large errors. Validation against 13 months of radiosonde data demonstrates robust performance with agreement rates exceeding 70 % in most months, with particularly effective performance during the wet season. This work provides a practical and cost-effective solution for autonomous cloud monitoring over the TP, with potential for application in other regions with limited observational data.

## 749. Enhanced Detection of Drought Events in California’s Central Valley Basin Using Rauch–Tung–Striebel Smoothed GRACE Level-2 Data: Mechanistic Insights from Climate–Hydrology Interactions

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223683](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223683)

**摘要**:

To mitigate the impact of north–south strip errors inherent in Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) spherical harmonic coefficient solutions, this research develops a state-space model to generate a more robust solution. The efficacy of the state-space model is demonstrated by comparing its performance with that of conventional filtering methods and hydrological modeling schemes. The method is subsequently applied to estimate the GRACE Groundwater Drought Index in the California Central Valley basin, a region significantly affected by drought during the GRACE observation period. This analysis quantifies the severity of droughts and floods while investigating the direct influences of precipitation, runoff, evaporation, and anthropogenic activities. By incorporating the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the study offers a detailed causal analysis and proposes a novel methodology for water resource management and disaster early warning. The results indicate that a moderate-duration flood event in 2006 resulted in a recharge of 19.81 km3 of water resources in the California Central Valley basin, whereas prolonged droughts in 2008 and 2013, lasting over 15 months, led to groundwater depletion of 41.53 km3 and 91.45 km3, respectively. Precipitation and runoff are identified as the primary determinants of local drought and flood conditions. The occurrence of ENSO events correlates with sustained precipitation variations over the subsequent 2–3 months, resulting in corresponding changes in groundwater storage.

**摘要**:

Abstract. This study explores the uncertainties in modeling organic aerosol (OA) over Central Europe, focusing on the roles of chemical mechanisms, emission parameterizations, and boundary conditions. Organic aerosols, particularly secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), significantly influence climate, health, and visibility, comprising up to 90 % of submicron particulate matter. Using the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecast Model, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and chemical boundary conditions on primary and secondary organic aerosol concentrations. Model evaluation against organic carbon measurements over the Czech Republic showed that including source-specific IVOC and SVOC emissions significantly improved CAMx's performance, particularly when using the 1.5-dimensional Volatility Basis Set framework with activated chemical aging. For example, the domain-averaged SOA concentrations increased by up to 1.17 µg m−3 during summer when both IVOC and SVOC emissions were included. Furthermore, incorporating OA into the boundary conditions enhanced model predictions, with the accuracy of modeled organic carbon concentrations significantly improved during summer at some monitoring sites. Despite these improvements, challenges remain due to uncertainties in emission estimates, parameterization schemes, and the spatial resolution of the models. The findings underscore the importance of refined parameterizations for IVOC and SVOC emissions, higher temporal and spatial resolution in chemical boundary conditions, and better representation of chemical aging. Addressing these gaps in future studies will further enhance the understanding and prediction of OA dynamics in regional air quality modeling.

**摘要**:

Abstract. In ice-rich polygonal tundra, spatiotemporal heterogeneity in ground-ice melt reshapes topography, impacting infrastructure, water and carbon cycles. This study evaluates changes in topography and subsurface structure at a coastal Arctic site by comparing data from two surveys conducted a decade apart. Each survey includes electrical resistivity tomography, active layer thickness, photogrammetry, and topographic data. Results reveal subsidence and decrease in permafrost table elevation with varying intensity and spatial distribution across polygons, alongside diverse thermal-hydrological responses, such as thermokarst pool formation in high-centered-polygons and more even subsidence in flat-centered-polygons. The study also underscores the value and limitations of sporadic surveys.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Chlorine radicals are strong oxidizing agents in the atmosphere, and the process of chlorine oxidation results in the formation of chloric acid (HClO3, CA). Recent studies have shown that trace amounts of CA have been detected in the Arctic boundary layer. However, the contribution of chlorine-containing species to oceanic new particle formation (NPF) has not been fully revealed. It is speculated that CA is involved in the oceanic nucleation process. In this study, the enhancement of CA-based NPF by dimethylamine (DMA) and sulfuric acid (SA) was comparatively investigated at the molecular level using density-functional theory (DFT) and atmospheric cluster dynamics simulation (ACDC). The results show that DMA can form clusters with CA through hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding and proton transfer, which reduces the energy barrier for CA-based cluster formation and significantly improves the thermodynamic stability of CA clusters. The cluster formation rate of CA-DMA cluster system is higher than that of the CA-SA cluster system. CA-DMA nucleation may not effectively contribute to Arctic NPF. These findings may help to reveal some of the missing sources of the Arctic NPF. The present study contributes to a deeper understanding of the influence of oceanic chlorine-containing constituents on the oceanic NPF.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Modeling station and satellite clocks in the GNSS analysis in order to reduce existing correlations requires a high level of stability for the corresponding clocks. In this contribution, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date status regarding the stability of on-board clocks of GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellites, as well as hydrogen maser stations within the International GNSS Service network. We use exemplary events of irregularities to show which factors need to be taken into account when analyzing a longer period of GNSS clocks. Based on epoch-wise clock biases estimated for different sampling rates (5 min / 30 s) in a daily network solution from May 2023 to April 2024, various stability analyses are carried out. About 60 of the 80 hydrogen maser stations distributed worldwide show a high stability with an average daily standard deviation of less than 75 picoseconds. For the satellite clocks the stability depends mainly on the atomic clock type and the age of the satellite block. In a further stability analysis, the 5-min clock estimates are subjected to a linear regression analysis with different interval lengths. The clock estimates of the younger satellite generations (GPS IIF, GPS IIIA, Galileo FOC) and the highly stable hydrogen maser stations can be well characterized by linear representations; assuming 10 mm as a threshold for the mean regression fit RMS, the maximum interval lengths are two and eight hours, respectively.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  AI-based emotion recognition approaches may benefit from the integration of multimodal data, but their explainability and validation is still a critical challenge. Indeed, the limited neurophysiological understanding of novel multimodal features, e.g. brain-heart interaction, can be insufficient to assess whether the AI-extracted physiological insights (i.e., the model explanations) accurately reflect the real underlying physiological processes. To validate the explanations obtained by an AI-based model in this context, we introduce a novel framework that autonomously identifies the optimal explanations for a black-box model used in emotion recognition. Our approach leverages a convolutional neural network to process BHI features, which are derived from EEG and HRV data and rearranged as images. A model-agnostic methodology is employed to extract local explanations, which are then dynamically evaluated to select the most accurate for representing specific emotional states. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated across multiple classification tasks, including up to 9-level arousal and valence emotion classification, as well as nine discrete emotions classification, using the MAHNOB-HCI and DEAP datasets. The system achieved remarkable accuracy levels, consistently reaching approximately 97–98% across all tasks. Furthermore, our dynamic selection framework revealed that Integrated Gradients outperformed other state-of-the-art explainable AI approaches in reliably capturing global explanations.

**摘要**:

The soil freeze–thaw process is a dominant disturbance in the seasonally frozen ground and the active layer of permafrost, which plays a crucial role in the surface energy balance, water cycle, and carbon exchange and has a pronounced influence on vegetation phenology. This study proposes a novel density-based Freeze–Thaw Disturbance Index (FTDI) based on the identification of the freeze–thaw disturbance region (FTDR) over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP). FTDI is defined as an areal density metric based on geomorphic disturbances, i.e., the proportion of FTDRs within a given region, with higher values indicating greater areal densities of disturbance. As a measure of landform clustering, FTDI complements existing freeze–thaw process indicators and provides a means to assess the geomorphic impacts of climate-driven freeze–thaw changes during permafrost degradation. The main conclusions are as follows: the FTDR results that are identified by the random forest model are reliable and highly consistent with ground observations; the FTDRs cover 8.85% of the total area of the QTP, and mainly in the central and eastern regions, characterized by prolonged freezing durations and the average annual ground temperature (MAGT) is close to 0 °C, making the soil in these regions highly susceptible to warming-induced disturbances. Most of the plateau exhibits low or negligible FTDI values. As a geomorphic indicator, FTDI reflects the impact of potential freeze–thaw dynamic phase changes on the surface. Higher FTDI values indicate a greater likelihood of surface thawing processes triggered by rising temperatures, which impact surface processes. Regions with relatively high FTDI values often contain substantial amounts of organic carbon, and may experience delayed vegetation green-up despite general warming trends. This study introduces the FTDI derived from the FTDR as a novel index, offering fresh insights into the study of freeze–thaw processes in the context of climate change.

**摘要**:

Abstract. In September 2022, the METHANE-To-Go Africa (MTGA) scientific aircraft campaign, part of UNEP's International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) Methane Science Studies, conducted the first methane (CH4) emissions measurements from the offshore oil and gas sector in West Africa. Using aircraft-based mass balance methods, we quantified trace gas emissions from all 57 Angolan offshore facilities, estimating total sector emissions and assessing 30 individual sites and 10 facility groups, thereby providing the first independent dataset for this previously unstudied region. Emissions were generally consistent across repeated measurements, but two facilities showed intermittent high emissions of 10 and 4 t h−1, significantly influencing total emissions. Older, shallow-water platforms emitted more than newer, deep-water floating production facilities. These findings suggest that production volume is a poor proxy for CH4 emissions, while age and maintenance status are more reliable indicators. Due to operational variability, regular monitoring remains essential, particularly for older facilities.  We estimate total CH4 emissions at 16.9±5.3th-1, only 20 %–22 % of EDGAR and CAMS inventory estimates, but over twice the operator-reported values. Additional trace gas measurements (CO2, CO, C2H6, SO2, NOy, and aerosols) suggest CH4 stems primarily from fugitive emissions and venting, not combustion. The calculated carbon intensity of Angolan offshore oil and gas is 3.4±0.8 g CO2 eq MJ−1, with nearly equal contributions from CH4 and CO2. Notably, shallow-water platforms are CH4-dominated, while deep-water facilities mostly emit CO2. These results improve our understanding of greenhouse gas emissions from offshore production in a key oil- and gas-producing region.

## 765. Exploring sources of ice crystals in cirrus clouds: comparative analysis of two ice nucleation schemes in CAM6

**作者**: Kai Lyu, Xiaohong Liu, Bernd Kärcher

**期刊**: Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics

**发表日期**: 2025-11-10

**DOI**: [10.5194/acp-25-15369-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-25-15369-2025)

**摘要**:

Abstract. Ice crystal formation in cirrus clouds is poorly understood, and its representation remains a challenge in global climate models. To enhance the understanding, a novel ice nucleation parameterization based on the Kärcher (2022) (K22) scheme is introduced into the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6). To investigate ice formation in cirrus clouds, sensitivity tests are conducted to analyze three ice sources from orographic gravity wave (OGWs), convective detrainment, and turbulence. These tests employ both the K22 scheme and the default Liu and Penner (2005) (LP05) scheme. Model evaluation includes 6-year climatology and nudged simulations representing the Small Particles in Cirrus (SPARTICUS) and O2 / N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean Study (ORCAS) campaigns. Both schemes simulate that convection detrained and turbulence-induced ice crystals are concentrated in low- to mid-latitudes, whereas OGW-induced ice crystals are concentrated in mid- to high latitudes. Compared to the LP05 scheme, the K22 scheme generates a higher number of ice crystals. The simulated cloud microphysical properties using the K22 scheme align well with observations for orographic cirrus during the SPARTICUS campaign. In orographic cirrus over high terrains at mid- to high latitudes, both schemes identify OGW-induced ice crystals as the dominant ice source. Due to its distinct competition parameterizations, the K22 scheme exhibits less contribution from minor ice sources (convection detrained and turbulence-induced). This underscores the significance of competition mechanisms within ice nucleation schemes and helps clarify regional and dynamical controls on ice sources in cirrus clouds. The application of two distinct nucleation schemes provides valuable insights into the dominant ice sources in cirrus clouds.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Medium-scale gravity waves (MSGWs) are atmospheric waves with horizontal scales ranging from 50 to 1000 km that can be observed through airglow all-sky images. This research introduces a novel algorithm that automatically identifies MSGWs using the keogram technique to study the waves over the Antarctic Peninsula. MSGWs were observed with an all-sky airglow imager located at the Brazilian Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station (CF, 62° S), near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Several preprocessing techniques are necessary to extract the parameters of MSGWs from the airglow images. These include projecting the images into geographical coordinates, applying a flat-field correction, performing consecutive image subtraction, and employing a Butterworth filter to enhance the visibility of the MSGWs. Additionally, a wavelet transform is used to identify the primary oscillations of the MSGWs in the keograms. Subsequently, a wavelet transform is also used to reconstruct the MSGWs and obtain the fitting coefficients of phase lines. The fitting coefficients are then used to calculate the MSGW parameters and assess the quality of the results. Simulations with synthetic images containing typical propagating gravity waves were conducted to evaluate the errors generated during the MSGW calculations and to determine the threshold for the fitting parameters. This methodology processed a year's worth of data in less than 1 h, successfully identifying most waves with errors lower than 5 %. The observed wave parameters are generally consistent with expected results; however, they show differences from other observation sites, exhibiting larger phase speeds and wavelengths.

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  Future projections of South American (SA) monsoon precipitation from CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6) show a consistent drying during the early part of the monsoon season (September to November), which is also seen in a convection-permitting model simulation. Using a set of idealised atmosphere-only GCM experiments, this drying signal is shown to be mainly driven by sea surface temperature (SST) changes: uniform SST warming and patterned SST change. Different processes appear to be more important in different months for the ensemble mean drying signal, with this primarily driven by SST pattern change in October and by uniform SST warming in November. There is significant inter-model uncertainty in the SA monsoon precipitation response to each of these drivers, particularly SST pattern change. For uniform SST warming, an existing hypothesis which suggests that SA monsoon drying is driven by the enhanced land-sea temperature contrast is tested, but we find that this process is not dominant. For patterned SST warming, moderate inter-model correlations (across the coupled CMIP6 models) are found between SA monsoon precipitation change and changes in meridional and zonal Atlantic SST gradients. In November, a combined zonal and meridional Atlantic SST gradient index can explain more than half of CMIP6 inter-model uncertainty in SA monsoon core region precipitation change.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Throughout history, extreme storms and droughts have had serious impacts on society and ecosystems globally. Rainfall variability particularly has been identified as a primary manifestation of climate change. However, so far little has been done to explore the effect of rainfall variability on water quality. This study aims to investigate the effect of rainfall variability on nitrogen (N) dynamics and its potential influence on water quality. The transport of water and nitrate was simulated for a small agricultural catchment in central Germany using the fully coupled surface-subsurface model HydroGeoSphere. Rainfall time series with specific climatic characteristics were generated using a stochastic rainfall generator. N transformation and transport were compared for four scenarios (wet, normal, dry and extremely dry conditions) in order to identify the impact of inter-annual rainfall variability. The results suggest that higher annual precipitation enhances N transformation and transport, whereas lower annual precipitation is conducive to the N retention capacity. The retention capacity declines severely when vegetation suffers from drought stress, suggesting that vegetation plays a vital role in the response of N dynamics to extreme droughts. The linear regressions between selected parameters of the rainfall generator and N loads/fluxes were analyzed to elucidate the impact of intra-annual rainfall variability. The results indicate that wet/dry conditions and different dry–wet patterns caused by storm duration distributions and inter-storm period distributions can significantly affect N loads and in-stream nitrate concentration, respectively. In the warm season, droughts prompt the accumulation of soil organic nitrogen (SON), but drying-wetting cycles can enhance the extensive transformation of SON. In-stream nitrate concentration dramatically elevates during the rewetting period after a drought. Wet/dry conditions and patterns of precipitation intensity within a year determined by seasonal average rainfall intensity and the probability of drizzle events prominently alter mineralization and plant uptake. Elevated mean rainfall intensity has a small effect on stream water quality. Therefore, mineralization and plant uptake are critical processes governing N dynamics and the impact of nitrate on water quality under varying rainfall conditions. Overall, the study clarifies the effect of rainfall variability on N dynamics in a small agricultural catchment, which provides theoretical support for formulating fertilization strategies and protecting aquatic ecosystems under climate change.

## 772. User migration in blockchain-based online social networks through the lens of temporal node representation shift

**作者**: Manuel Dileo, Matteo Zignani

**期刊**: Machine Learning

**发表日期**: 2025-11-10

**DOI**: [10.1007/s10994-025-06905-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-025-06905-y)

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  User migration in online social networks represents a critical phenomenon that can reshape platform dynamics and lead to abrupt structural changes, often triggered by technical, social, or competitive factors. In the context of blockchain-based online social networks, migration events can be particularly disruptive when triggered by hard forks - fundamental splits in the underlying blockchain protocol that create two incompatible versions of the platform. However, understanding how users adapt their behavior before, during, and after such events remains a challenging research question. To address this challenge, we rely on the framework of graph representation learning, with a particular focus on Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs). In particular, we analyze how node representations returned by TGNNs evolve during the migration event and examine how representation shifts can mirror changes in users’ behavioral patterns and platform interactions. Our study focuses on Steemit, a blockchain-based social network that experienced a significant user migration following a hard fork in its supporting blockchain infrastructure. Our findings highlight that both the prediction performance and node representation are influenced by the occurrence of the migration event. We detect shifts in node representations that correspond to changes in individual user behavior throughout the event. Furthermore, group-centric analysis reveals changes in behavior and memberships among similar users during different transition periods. Additionally, we find a level of polarization in node representations caused by the migration event, which gradually diminishes over time, resulting in more evenly distributed dimensions of node representations months after the first migration. We compare our approach against two baselines based on network statistics and pre-trained LLM embeddings, showing that TGNNs better capture the distribution shift derived by the migration. To summarize, this work offers valuable insights into user behavior dynamics during platform migrations, demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal graph learning approaches in analyzing such transitions in an automated manner.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Extreme weather events pose significant challenges to crop production, making their assessment essential for developing effective climate adaptation strategies. Process-based crop models are valuable for evaluating climate change impacts on crop yields but often struggle to simulate the effects of extreme weather accurately. To fill this knowledge gap, this study introduces WOFOST-EW v1, an enhanced version of the World Food Studies Simulation Model (WOFOST), which integrates extreme weather indices and deep learning algorithm to improve simulations of winter wheat growth under extreme conditions. Deep learning offers powerful nonlinear fitting capabilities, enabling it to capture subtle and intricate interactions between extreme weather events and crop development, thereby significantly improving simulation accuracy under extreme scenarios. We validate WOFOST-EW using phenological, yield, and extreme weather data from agricultural meteorological stations in the North China Plain. The results show that WOFOST-EW improves simulation accuracy. The RRMSE for heading and maturity decreases from 4.61 % to 3.73 % and from 4.74 % to 3.98 %, respectively (with RMSE reductions of 10.64 % and 12.86 %). The R2 value for yield simulations increases from 0.67 to 0.76. In addition, we further validate the WOFOST-EW model in years affected by extreme weather and find that, compared to the original WOFOST model (R2 ranging from 0.61 to 0.71), WOFOST-EW achieves more accurate results (R2 ranging from 0.80 to 0.86). WOFOST-EW effectively captures the impacts of extreme weather, offering a reliable tool for agricultural planning and climate adaptation. As extreme weather events become increasingly frequent, WOFOST-EW can assist decision-makers in more accurately evaluating crop yields, providing technical support for agricultural systems in the context of global climate change.

## 775. The spatial distribution of convective precipitation – an evaluation of cloud microphysics schemes with polarimetric radar observations

**作者**: Gregor Köcher, Tobias Zinner

**期刊**: Geoscientific Model Development

**DOI**: [10.5194/gmd-18-8363-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-18-8363-2025)

**摘要**:

Abstract. The representation of cloud microphysics in numerical weather prediction models contributes significantly to the uncertainty of weather forecasts. Polarimetric radar observations are increasingly used to evaluate numerical weather simulations, due to their sensitivity to microphysical properties. Typically, this evaluation is performed for individual case studies, which limits the generalizability of the results. This is particularly problematic for convective precipitation events, which are characterized by high variability due to their small scale and rapid error growth of initial uncertainties, and are often associated with severe weather phenomena. In this study, the performance of microphysics schemes in the simulation of convective precipitation events is evaluated statistically over a 30 d dataset. The aim is to assess the distribution of precipitation into convective and stratiform regions, and the microphysical properties in these regions based on radar reflectivity and differential reflectivity. Within a Weather Research and Forecasting model setup, 5 different microphysics schemes of varying complexity are evaluated. The choice of microphysics schemes has a significant impact on the distribution of precipitation; the median convective area fraction varies by an order of magnitude between the microphysics schemes. These differences are attributed to differences in rain drop size distributions. In the convective core, the FSBM and Morrison schemes frequently lack large rain drops, while the Thompson and P3 schemes simulate too many. Statistical evaluations are important to address the prevailing uncertainty surrounding cloud microphysics. The framework presented in this study can serve as a guide for future statistical evaluations of weather models with polarimetric radar observations.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223680](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223680)

**摘要**:

A clustering ensemble, which leverages multiple base clusterings to obtain a reliable consensus result, is a critical challenging task for Earth observation in remote sensing applications. With the development of multi-source remote sensing data, exploring the underlying graph-structured patterns has become increasingly important. However, existing clustering ensemble methods mostly employ shallow clustering in the base clustering generation stage, which fails to utilize the structural information. Moreover, the high dimensionality inherent in data further increases the difficulty of clustering. To address these problems, we propose a novel method termed Global Self-Attention-driven Graph Clustering Ensemble (GSAGCE). Specifically, GSAGCE firstly adopts basic autoencoders and global self-attention graph autoencoders (GSAGAEs) to extract node attribute information and structural information, respectively. GSAGAEs not only enhance structural information in the embedding but also have the capability to capture long-range vertex dependencies. Next, we employ a fusion strategy to adaptively fuse this dual information by considering the importance of nodes through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we design a self-supervised strategy to adjust the clustering distribution, which integrates the attribute and structural embeddings as more reliable guidance to produce base clusterings. In the ensemble strategy, we devise a double-weighted graph partitioning consensus function that simultaneously considers both global and local diversity within the base clusterings to enhance the consensus performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GSAGCE compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Both size and mixing state of Black Carbon (BC) are critical climate-relevant physical parameters. It remains a challenge for ambient measurements to characterize their variability across different atmospheric conditions particularly in outflow regions. To investigate how BC's physical properties are determined in source regions and altered during transport, we conducted 23 flight measurements of BC, CO, and CO2 over the Yellow Sea from 2021 to 2022. The refractory BC mass concentration (MrBC) varied by up to two orders of magnitude between near sea surface and around 5 km above sea level, and Planetary Boundary Layer height-dependence of MrBC was stronger in winter than in spring. Smallest rBC's mass median diameter (MMD, 163.4 nm) observed in South Korea-sourced air indicated fresh urban emissions, whereas larger MMD, enhanced internal mixing, and higher rBC/CO slopes were exhibited in the air masses from North Korea and China, reflecting additional emissions from biomass and coal combustion. Both MMD and internal mixing tended to decrease with altitude, highlighting the wet scavenging effect during particle transport. When accumulated precipitation exceeded 1 mm, MrBC decreased by more than 50 %, with moderate decrease in MMD and internal mixing. As a result, overall BC transport efficiency declined to 1/e within 5.5 d. These observations reflect the complex effects of source region, seasonality, and wet removal on varying rBC distributions in the outflow region. These findings provide valuable observational constraints for improving model representations of the size distribution and mixing state of ambient BC particles in outflow regions.

**DOI**: [10.3390/rs17223684](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17223684)

**摘要**:

Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is a basic and significant task in remote sensing, the aim of which is to assign a class label to each pixel in an image. Recently, deep learning networks have been widely applied in HSI classification. They can extract discriminative spectral–spatial features through spectral weighting and multiscale spatial information modeling. However, existing spectral weighting mechanisms lack the ability to explore the inter-class spectral overlap caused by spectral variability. Moreover, current multiscale fusion strategies ignore semantic conflicts between features with large-scale differences. To address these problems, a class-aware progressive multiscale fusion transformer (CPMFFormer) is proposed. It first introduces class information into a spectral weighting mechanism. This helps CPMFFormer to learn class-specific spectral weights and enhance class-discriminative spectral features. Then, a center residual convolution module is constructed to extract features at different scales. It is embedded with a center feature calibration layer to achieve hierarchical enhancement of representative spatial features. Finally, a progressive multiscale fusion strategy is designed to promote effective collaboration between features at different scales. It achieves a smooth semantic transition by gradually fusing adjacent scale features. Experiments using five public HSI datasets show that CPMFFormer is rational and effective.

**摘要**:

Marine oil spill incidents are one of the major global marine pollution issues, which pose significant threats to ocean ecosystems. However, traditional monitoring methods often suffer from time delays, high costs, and limited real-time capability, making them inadequate for timely and large-scale oil spill detection. With the development of remote sensing (RS) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, as well as the increasing frequency of marine oil spill accidents, plenty of AI-based methods using RS imagery have been proposed for more efficient and accurate oil spill monitoring. This review presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of recent progress in marine oil spill analysis using RS imagery, emphasizing the integration of AI methods across three key tasks: detection, classification, and thickness estimation. Specifically, we first introduce the main types of RS data and discuss the significance of publicly available datasets, which can facilitate method validation and model comparison. Second, we briefly review the application of RS imagery from different sensors in oil spill detection, highlighting the strengths of various spectral and polarimetric methods. Third, we summarize advances in oil spill classification, including AI-based methods that enable differentiation between mineral oil, biogenic films, and various emulsified oils. Fourth, we discuss emerging techniques for oil spill thickness estimation. Finally, we analyze the challenges of existing methods and future directions, including the need for real-time monitoring, the integration of multi-source RS data, and the development of robust models that can generalize across different environmental conditions. This review adopts a comprehensive perspective from both AI methods and RS technology, provides a systematic overview of recent advancements, identifies critical gaps in current methodologies, and serves as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners working on oil spill monitoring.

## 781. Shaping shallow landslide susceptibility as a function of rainfall events

**摘要**:

Abstract. This paper tests a multivariate statistical model to simulate rainfall-dependent susceptibility scenarios of shallow landslides. To this end, extreme rainfall events spanning from 1977 to 2021 in the Orba basin (a study area of 595 km2 located in Piedmont, northern Italy) have been considered. First of all, the role of conditioning and triggering factors on the spatial pattern of shallow landslides in areas with complex geological conditions is analysed by comparing their spatial distribution and their influence within logistic regression models, with results showing that rainfall and specific lithological and geomorphological conditions exert the strongest control on the spatial pattern of landslides. Different rainfall-based scenarios were then modelled using logistic regression models trained on different combinations of past events and evaluated using an ensemble of performance metrics. Models calibrated on multiple events outperform the ones based on a single event, since they are capable of compensating for local misleading effects that can arise from the use of a single rainfall event. The best-performing developed model considers all the landslide-triggering rainfall scenarios and two non-triggering intense rainfall events, with a score of 0.90 out of 1 on the multi-criteria TOPSIS-based1 performance index. Finally, a new approach based on misclassification costs is proposed to account for false negatives and false positives in the predicted susceptibility maps. Overall, this approach based on a multi-event calibration and on a misclassification cost analysis shows promise in producing rainfall-dependent shallow landslide susceptibility scenarios that could be used for hazard analyses and early warning systems and could assist decision-makers in developing risk mitigation strategies.

**摘要**:

Abstract. Channelized basal melting is a critical process influencing ice shelf weakening, as basal channels create zones of thinning and vulnerability that can potentially lead to ice shelf destabilization. In this study, we reveal and examine the rapid development of a channel within the George VI Ice Shelf's extensive channelized network, characterized by a 23 m surface lowering over a nine-year period. We study changes in ice flow, ocean circulation and heat potential as possible drivers behind the channel, under the hypotheses that it is either a fracture, a basal melt channel, or a combination of the two. Our findings show that the onset of this channel coincides with significant changes in ocean forcing, including increased ocean temperatures and salinity, that occurred during the 2015 El Niño Southern Oscillation event. Modelling of basal melting further suggests that channel re-routing has taken place over this nine-year period, with the new channel serving as a basal melt channel in the latest years. We further observe subtle shifts in ice flow indicative of fracturing. Our findings thus indicate that this channel likely contributes to the weakening of an already thin ice shelf through a combination of basal melting and fracturing. These findings offer insight into how similar potentially destabilizing processes could unfold on other Antarctic ice shelves. Monitoring the evolution of this channel and its impact on ice shelf integrity will be critical for understanding the mechanisms of ice shelf retreat, especially on heavily channelized ice shelves.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  The widespread diffusion of text black-box classifiers necessitates explainable AI (XAI) techniques for this domain. A seminal XAI technique is Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). For text classification, LIME maps an input sentence and its neighbours into a bag of words, using a linear regressor as an interpretable model. However, this strategy has significant limitations. Neighbouring sentences are constructed solely by extracting subsets of the input sentence, which may fail to accurately capture the local decision boundary. Moreover, these subsets are not guaranteed to be representative of the classification classes, potentially leading to unbalanced or misleading interpretability. Additionally, such generated sentences might lack semantic coherence. Furthermore, the resulting explanation is often limited to confirming the relevance of a term or highlighting the impact of its removal, without providing deeper insights. This work tries to overcome these limitations by proposing LLiMean extension of LIME that exploits advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform a classifier-driven generation of the neighbourhood. Our approach allows neighbours to employ a vocabulary larger than that of the input text. A generation procedure is introduced to more effectively capture the local decision boundary by ensuring generated samples span all classes involved in the classification. Additionally, an LLM-driven explanation and a counterfactual generation procedure are presented, returning the most relevant set of editing operations to influence the black-box predictor’s decision. Thus, the approach provides a richer, easier-to-interpret explanation and high-quality counterfactuals compared to standard LIME. Experiments on real datasets witness the technique’s effectiveness in providing suitable, relevant, and interpretable explanations.

**发表日期**: 2025-11-10

**DOI**: [10.1093/gji/ggaf453](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggaf453)

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>
                  Earthquake monitoring plays a critical role in disaster warning and geophysical research, including earthquake phase picking and source parameter estimation. However, traditional methods suffer from cumbersome workflow and challenges in parameter selection during multi-parameter joint estimation. Here, we propose a multitask network for earthquake monitoring that reduces computational complexity by replacing the self-attention mechanism with fast Fourier transform. Through the integration of a fusion module and an enhancement module, the interaction between tasks is strengthened to optimize network performance. Additionally, a dynamic adaptive weight allocation strategy is introduced to achieve a balance among different tasks. The proposed method was trained and tested on the STEAD and INSTANCE datasets and compared with advanced approaches. The results demonstrate that this method outperforms other deep learning methods in earthquake phase picking and source parameter estimation, achieving lower errors and higher evaluation metrics, thus showing potential for practical application in earthquake monitoring.

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>
                  We efficiently extract high-quality Pn wave arrival times from seismograms recorded at recently deployed 120 portable seismic stations of TanluArrays and 317 stations of the Chinese provincial seismic network for 7231 local earthquakes (M &amp;gt;2.0) using the PickNet automatic picking method. Then we use the Pn data to determine 2-D P-wave velocity and anisotropic tomography of the uppermost mantle in and around the Tanlu Fault Zone. Our Pn tomography reveals segmented features of the fault zone, which are well consistent with geological structural features. A continuous low-velocity anomaly parallel to the fault zone is revealed along the Bohai Bay-Weifang, Weifang-Tancheng, and Tancheng-Mingguang segments, whereas the Mingguang-Wuxue segment exhibits a bead-like alternating high and low velocity belt. A similar segmented characteristic also appears in the Pn wave anisotropy in and around the fault zone. A majority of strong earthquakes are located in transitional zones between high and low Pn velocities, suggesting that structural heterogeneities in the uppermost mantle may affect crustal seismogenesis. The low Pn velocities may reflect upwelling of hot and wet upwelling flows in the big mantle wedge due to mantle convection and dehydration of the flat Pacific slab in the mantle transition zone, which cause seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle in and around the Tanlu fault zone.

**摘要**:

The southern Superior Province (Canada) comprises large metasedimentary belts, such as the Pontiac and Quetico subprovinces, adjacent to Au-endowed greenstone belts. The Pontiac sedimentary rocks have been proposed as a source of Au for the highly endowed southern Abitibi greenstone belt. However, a comparison with sedimentary rocks adjacent to poorly endowed greenstone belts is lacking. Here we examine a suite of metasedimentary and minor volcanic rocks collected from three transects in the Pontiac and Quetico metasedimentary belts adjacent to greenstone belts with variable Au endowments. We combine in situ Au data of sulfides in metasedimentary rocks with whole-rock ultra-low-detection Au data. Gold concentrations decrease across metamorphic isograds in the well- and moderately endowed transects, while limited Au mobility is observed in the poorly endowed transect. The release of Au from metasedimentary rocks is linked to the pyrite-pyrrhotite transition. This reaction is incomplete in the poorly endowed transect, explaining the limited Au mobility observed. Our data reveal a spatial correlation between Au mobility in metasedimentary belts and Au endowment in the adjacent greenstone belts.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The climate of the western coast of South America is controlled by large climate systems known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the Subtropical Pacific High (SPH) and the Southern Hemisphere Westerly wind (SWW) belt. While the large-scale evolution of the SWW belt and the location of the ITCZ are well constrained, the interaction between these two climate features is not well understood as a high resolution spatial and temporal reconstruction of the SWW belt is still lacking. Here, we use the hydrogen isotope ratios of leaf-wax n-alkanes in marine sediments between 33 and 36° S offshore Chile to reconstruct past hydrological regimes and the evolution of the SWW belt since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 20 000 cal yr BP). Our results reveal distinct dry and wet phases caused by the past latitudinal migration of the SWW belt – with wetter intervals associated with a northerly SWW belt and drier intervals associated with a southerly SWW belt. Our findings imply a northward position of the SWW belt during the LGM, followed by a southward migration of the SWW belt during the deglaciation period. This shift southward was briefly interrupted during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ca. 14 700 to 13 000 cal yr BP). The SWW belt reached its southernmost latitudes during the early Holocene. At ca. 7500 yr BP, a displacement northward of the SWW belt was detected at latitudes south of 36° S and, during the last 5500 years, the SWW belt progressively migrated northward. From 17 000 to 11 500 cal yr BP, these migrations appear to be tied to atmospheric circulation regimes resulting from large changes in the interhemispheric temperature gradient and subsequent changes in the Hadley cell circulation, while the migrations in the Holocene (11 500 cal yr BP to present) appear to be predominantly controlled by insolation and atmospheric circulation regimes resembling those of El Niño-Southern Oscillation events.

**摘要**:

Abstract. The media, especially the press, play a crucial role in shaping public understanding during risk and crisis management, acting as intermediaries between various actors and the public. However, their framing of sources can introduce biases into these representations. Limited analysis exists regarding how press coverage portrays relationships between crisis and risk management actors. Using social network analysis, this study maps quotation networks in press coverage of a seismo-volcanic crisis in Mayotte, a French overseas department. This approach allows for an overview of the relationships between actors, highlights unique aspects related to the context and media portrayal, reveals underlying representations and levels of trust among interviewed actors, and visualises the network's dynamics over time. Analysis revealed variations in narrative approaches among newspapers, with some focusing on specific aspects. The results show that national authorities received more attention than local elected representatives and that scientific figures dominated reported speech, while the population's perspective remained relatively passive despite its centrality to the quotation network. Prominent individuals held significant positions, emphasising the importance of personal connections in communication and revealing a potential distrust of political and scientific institutions. This finding underscores the need for greater proximity between information sources and the affected community.

                    In 2020, a record‐breaking 10.1 million acres burned in US wildfires. To investigate this prolific fire season's impacts on US air quality, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s 72‐hr Unified Forecast System Air Quality Model (UFS‐AQM) is run once‐daily from 15 August–30 September 2020. A meteorological and air quality‐based forecast verification is carried out for this period. The 72‐hr forecasts of near‐surface temperature, moisture, and winds perform quite well against observations in terms of correlation and bias. The UFS‐AQM surface ozone and fine particulate matter (PM

                    ) often concur with US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirNow station data, though the model ozone displays a consistent positive bias ranging from 8.5 to 15.4 ppb. Anomalously poor PM

                    predictions are identified during extreme wildfire activity in the Pacific Northwest between 13 and 20 September. Here, in addition to periods of widespread cloudiness, smoke is quite thick. As a result, fire activity is obscured from satellite detection. The UFS‐AQM thus underestimates wildfire emissions in the Pacific Northwest. The lack of dynamic aerosol–radiation interactions in UFS‐AQM coupled with uncertainties in fire emissions leads to a large underestimation of surface PM

                    there, along with high temperature and low humidity biases. Finally, satellite‐based measurements are also employed to evaluate the UFS‐AQM's performance in the deeper troposphere. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite 550‐nm aerosol optical depth provides additional insights into the UFS‐AQM's handling of smoke transport, while the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument suggests UFS‐AQM suffers from overpredictions of NO

**摘要**:

Abstract. Tundra ecosystems are characterized by small, rare and infrequent fires due to cold, often waterlogged conditions, and limited biomass. However, ongoing climate warming and drying in northern soils and peatlands are contributing to increasingly frequent and extensive wildfires. To place recent fire regimes in the context of long-term variability and to better understand interactions between fire, moisture, and vegetation, we reconstructed wildfire history over the past 3000 years using a network of charcoal, vegetation, and hydrological records in combination with satellite-derived fire datasets from northern Arctic Alaska peatlands. The composite charcoal record shows minimal fire activity from ∼ 1000 BCE to 1000 CE, followed by a modest increase between 1000 and 1200 CE, and then a renewed decline. This long-term pattern shifted abruptly after 1900 CE, reaching its maximum between 1950 and 2015 CE, when fire activity exceeded any levels observed in the preceding three millennia. Individual charcoal records show a spatially heterogeneous pattern in fire occurrence before 1950 CE, and a more homogeneous one thereafter. Our findings suggest that the deepening of water tables and peatland drying associated with permafrost thaw have facilitated woody encroachment, especially by more flammable Ericaceous shrubs. These vegetation changes have increased fuel availability and flammability, ultimately driving the recent surge in wildfire activity, highlighting the growing vulnerability of Arctic tundra ecosystems to fire. We also found that the charcoal source area of our tundra fire reconstruction encompasses broader landscapes over tens of kilometres. Our study emphasizes the significance of long-term, multidisciplinary research in documenting moisture–vegetation–fire feedbacks that influence tundra fire regimes. Ultimately, this long-term fire dynamic study provides critical context for evaluating recent changes and incorporating tundra peatland fire risk into global climate mitigation strategies.

                    In recent years, solar‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has shown great potential for monitoring terrestrial photosynthesis, but existing satellite SIF retrievals typically feature coarse spatial resolutions on the order of kilometers or larger. Recently, the Chinese Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Inventory Satellite, Goumang, launched in August 2022, carries a unique SIF Imaging Spectrometer (SIFIS), the first spaceborne sensor especially designed for global SIF retrieval. SIFIS provides a high spatial resolution (370 × 800 m) and high spectral resolution (0.24, 664–786 nm), enabling the same order of SIF retrieval error (∼0.48 mW/m
                    <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>
                    /nm/sr) as other satellite SIF products. The SIFIS radiance measurement and SIF retrievals were first validated using the airborne AisaIBIS data. SIFIS SIF showed high spatial and temporal agreement with independent satellite SIF data sets and high correlations with flux tower estimates of gross primary production (R

## 796. Environmental Controls on Water Vapor Deuterium Excess in the Coastal Boundary Layer: An Information Theory Perspective

**摘要**:

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  We use information theory to quantify the environmental controls on water vapor deuterium excess (D‐excess) in coastal Southern California from June 2023 through February 2024. Using Shannon entropy, mutual information (MI), and joint mutual information, metrics that capture both linear and nonlinear relationships, we identify the most informative variables and variable combinations governing D‐excess across contrasting marine and continental regimes. Relative humidity with respect to sea surface temperature (RHS) is consistently the strongest individual predictor, explaining up to 27% of D‐excess variability during marine conditions but only 10% in continental air masses. The Relative humidity(RHS) + sea surface temperature (SST) combination demonstrates synergistic effects, where their joint influence (explaining up to 36% of D‐excess variability) exceeds what either variable achieves individually, confirming their coupled influence on deuterium excess. Wind direction complements RHS most effectively during continental conditions. The best three‐variable combination (RHS + SST + Planetary Boundary Layer height) explains 38% of D‐excess variability in marine air, while no combination exceeds 20% explanatory power during continental periods. Information theory shows that heteroscedasticity in D‐excess relationships indicates regime shifts in controlling processes and quantifies fundamental constraints on predictor variables: some environmental factors like surface pressure or water vapor flux contain insufficient information content to explain D‐excess variability regardless of their physical relevance. These results highlight the different predictability limits between marine and continental regimes, challenging the adequacy of linear models and providing a rigorous framework for quantifying the information content of isotope‐climate relationships with implications for both modern and paleoclimate applications.
